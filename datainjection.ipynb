For example, one\\nof the largest networks, Strava, has over 100 million registered\\nusers [50]. These fitness tracking social networks allow users to\\nrecord their sports activities, and share their tracks and achieve-\\nments with friends and other users of the platform, promoting\\nenjoyment and motivation [7]. The tracks represent the routes that\\nthe user followed during the activity. While sharing tracks forms\\npart of the attraction of these networks, this, however, comes with\\nprivacy and security risks, as they might reveal sensitive informa-\\ntion, such as the user’s regular routes or visited locations, to people\\nwith ill intentions. Several past incidents drew attention to the\\ndangers of sharing this data with the public, from revealing secret\\nmilitary locations [25], enabling theft of exercise equipment [10],\\nrevealing the identity of nearby athletes [45], to doxing users [39].\\nTo limit the potential risks of sharing information, all major\\nnetworks offer privacy controls that limit the amount of shared\\ninformation, as well as control whom information is shared with.\\nOne notable privacy control is the endpoint privacy zone (EPZ). An\\nEPZ allows users to hide track portions near protected (sensitive) lo-\\ncations, such as their home or work address, from all activity tracks\\nshown to other users. This measure aims to prevent harassment\\nand stalking at commonly visited locations [54], or criminal activity\\nsuch as theft at the protected locations [10]. Most commonly, EPZ\\nimplementations balance an increase in privacy with usability, no-\\ntably in terms of tracking fitness achievements, as features such as\\nleaderboards may only be available for publicly viewable data [14].\\nMoreover, activities usually still contain the full traveled distance,\\neven for the portions hidden by the EPZ. The user who created the\\nactivity can also still access the full activity, as shown in Figure 1.\\nOne implementation of EPZs hides track portions inside a circle\\nwith the sensitive location as its center and a user-configurable\\nradius. However, this implementation has fallen out of favor, as\\ngiven one or more tracks for one user, it is possible to reconstruct\\nthe privacy zone (i.e., the radius) and find the sensitive location\\n \\n801'),\n",

The interface dis-\\nplays the track ➀, the total traveled distance ➁ and accumu-\\nlated distance at each point (through the elevation profile\\n➂). Part of the track is marked as ‘hidden’ ➃, as it is cloaked\\nby an EPZ. Only the owner of the activity sees that part of\\nthe activity is hidden; other users only see the visible part\\nwithout any indication that another part is hidden.\\n(i.e., the center) through basic geometric inference. In 2018, Has-\\nsan et al. showed that this EPZ implementation is vulnerable to\\nautomated inference attacks [24]. In 2022, Mink et al. showed that\\nhuman users can visually infer privacy zones that use this imple-\\nmentation [35].\\nWe confirm through a systematic analysis that major fitness\\ntracking social networks implemented some countermeasures in\\nan attempt to better protect sensitive locations from these basic\\ninference attacks [24, 35]. These countermeasures include those\\nproposed by Hassan et al. [24]: larger radii, noise addition at the\\nEPZ boundary, and spatial cloaking where the EPZ center is ran-\\ndomly shifted. However, some usability trade-offs are made, such\\nas allowing small or only fixed radii, or not requiring spatial cloak-\\ning. Moreover, some fitness tracking social networks still do not\\nimplement EPZs at all.\\nIn this paper, we are the first to show that these newer imple-\\nmentations of EPZs remain highly vulnerable to the discovery of\\nthe purportedly protected location, even when countermeasures\\nsuch as spatial cloaking are applied. Our novel inference attack\\nleverages two inputs that enable a regression analysis resulting in\\nthe protected location for an EPZ. First, the road network restricts\\nthe possible paths that a user could have taken inside an EPZ. Sec-\\nond, the activity metadata leaks the exact distances of the paths\\nthat were traveled inside the EPZ. We then predict the protected\\nlocation as the point where the distances of the possible and actual\\npaths match best across multiple activities.\\nWe find through an evaluation on 1.4 million real-world Strava\\nactivities that our attack can deanonymize protected locations for\\nup to 85% of EPZs. Larger EPZ radii are more effective at preventing\\nlocation inference and preserving user privacy, but even for very\\nlarge radii (1 km), deanonymization remains possible for 55% of\\nEPZs. Through a detailed analysis of the sensitivity of our attack,\\nwe find that higher geographic activity diversity and lower street\\ndensity benefit its performance.\\nWe propose and evaluate six countermeasures that can restore\\nthe anonymity of locations protected by EPZs to a varying degree.\\nWe find that generalization (rounding) of reported activity distances\\nwould be the most effective countermeasure, although it comes with\\na significant negative usability impact, as fitness tracking social\\nnetworks are attractive precisely because they allow tracking small\\nachievement differences accurately. Other countermeasures may be\\nless invasive, but are then also less effective at improving privacy.\\nInterestingly, certain interventions such as regenerating EPZs may\\nactually improve our attack’s efficacy, as they provide more data\\nfrom which the protected location can be more reliably inferred.\\nCountermeasures must therefore be carefully evaluated in order\\nto minimize their negative impact on usability and privacy. We\\ndisclosed our findings and proposed countermeasures to the major\\nvulnerable fitness tracking social networks.\\nIn summary, we make the following contributions:\\n•We conduct a systematic analysis on current EPZ implemen-\\ntations for the most popular fitness tracking social networks.\\n•We develop a proof-of-concept attack that infers protected\\nlocations inside EPZs through regression analysis on the\\nroad network and leaked covered distances (Section 4).\\n•We evaluate our attack on 1.4 million real-world Strava ac-\\ntivities (Section 5). We discover sensitive locations for up to\\n85% of EPZs, and find that our attack performs better with\\ngeographically dispersed activities on sparse street grids\\n(Section 6).\\n•We propose six countermeasures to improve the anonymity\\nprovided by EPZs and discuss their trade-offs between pri-\\nvacy and usability (Section 7).\\n2 FITNESS TRACKING SOCIAL NETWORKS\\nOur work concerns fitness tracking social networks, where users can\\nrecord their workouts and share them with others. Users typically\\nrecord workouts using a GPS-enabled smartphone or wearable de-\\nvice and upload them in the form of activities. An activity contains\\na track, i.e., the route that the user took, represented by a series\\nof points (coordinates). The activity also reports the total distance\\ntraveled, as well as the accumulated distance at each point of the\\ntrack, along with other metadata such as the duration, pace, ele-\\nvation profile, heart rate, etc. Finally, many FTSNs define specific\\nstretches of road (e.g., ‘segments’ on Strava) where they maintain a\\nleaderboard of the fastest athletes across these stretches. Figure 1\\nshows what a fully developed activity may look like.\\nMost networks offer privacy controls that let users hide all activ-\\nities from other users (i.e., private profile) or mark specific activities\\nas hidden. Using these controls can severely limit the functionality\\nof social features for the affected activities. For example, activities\\nthat are marked as private by their owners cannot be viewed by\\nother users and may be ineligible for inclusion on segment leader-\\nboards and in challenges [14, 7].

EPZs allow\\nusers to hide the most sensitive parts of the tracks in their activities,\\nas they could otherwise reveal frequently visited locations such as\\nthe user’s home or workplace. Activities with EPZs applied to them\\ncan still be shared, but the hidden parts of the tracks may still be\\nineligible for performance comparisons, so users may be inclined\\nto disable or at least severely limit them. We discuss these zones in\\nmore detail in Section 3.\\n3 ENDPOINT PRIVACY ZONES\\nMost FTSNs allow their users to hide a privacy-sensitive location\\nby letting them define an Endpoint Privacy Zone (EPZ) around that\\nlocation. One location corresponds to exactly one EPZ, but a user\\ncan configure multiple locations that each have their own EPZ.\\nEPZs can be regenerated at any time and are applied retroactively\\nto all the activities of the owner. The goal of the EPZ is then to hide\\nthose parts of the track that might reveal the sensitive location, i.e.,\\nare near this location. Only the owner of the activity 𝑎can view\\nthe full track, including its actual start and finish points (together\\nthe ‘endpoints’), as well as the layout of the EPZ itself (shown\\nin Figure 2a). Other users only see a cloaked activity 𝑎′as defined\\nin Definition 1 and depicted in Figure 2b. Concretely, in such a\\ncloaked activity all points from the start of the track until the first\\ntime the owner leaves the EPZ are hidden, as are all points from the\\nlast time the owner enters the EPZ until the end of the track. The\\nother users therefore observe cloaked start and finish points. Note\\nthat if the owner passes through the EPZ but does not start or end\\nthere, that track portion through the EPZ is not hidden. Moreover,\\neven though the points inside the EPZ are hidden, the accumulated\\ndistance for points outside the EPZ as well as the total distance\\nare not changed. This forms the basis for our attack described in\\nSection 4.\\nDefinition 1 (Endpoint Privacy Zone). Let protected location 𝑝𝑠 =\\n(𝑥𝑠,𝑦𝑠)be a point in the Cartesian plane 𝐶, and 𝑎 be an activity\\nroute of𝑛points {𝑝1,...,𝑝 𝑛}. We denote𝑝1 as the actual start point\\nand 𝑝𝑛 as the actual finish point.\\nLet 𝐸𝑃𝑍 be a subplane of 𝐶. Enforcing 𝐸𝑃𝑍 on activity 𝑎results\\nin a cloaked activity 𝑎′= {𝑝𝑗,...,𝑝 𝑚}with 1 ≤𝑗 ≤𝑚 ≤𝑛, where\\n𝑝𝑗 is the first point and 𝑝𝑚 the last point of the activity route that\\ndoes not lie in 𝐸𝑃𝑍. We denote 𝑝𝑗 as the cloaked start point and\\n𝑝𝑚 as the cloaked finish point.\\nIn Table 1, we list the supported EPZ parameters of popular\\nFTSNs. Most FTSNs use circular EPZs and let the user select the\\nradius of the circle from a set of fixed radii. Hassan et al. inferred\\nprotected locations using publicly available information such as\\nthe advertised start and finish point of the user’s activity [24].\\nThe researchers demonstrated that, given multiple endpoints of\\nprotected activities and the circular layout of the EPZ, an adversary\\ncould reconstruct the EPZ and expose the protected location (i.e.,\\nthe center point of the EPZ). To deal with the aforementioned\\nattack, some FTSNs apply spatial cloaking by adding a random\\ntranslation to the center of the EPZs [23], resulting in a cloaked\\ncircular EPZ as defined in Definition 2. An adversary could still\\ndetermine the parameters of the cloaked EPZ, but cannot infer the\\nprotected location, since the protected location and the EPZ center\\ndo not match. Komoot uses a randomly shaped polygon around\\nthe protected location, rather than a circular EPZ. This makes it\\nmore difficult for an attacker to deduce the shape of the privacy\\nzone [28]. Map My Tracks has an automatic privacy zone detection\\ntool, lowering the bar for users to create a privacy zone [37]. This\\nautomatic tool scans all new activity endpoints in order to identify\\nregular start and finish locations. If such locations are detected, a\\n(circular) EPZ is enforced on all activities retroactively. This feature\\nis enabled by default but can be disabled by the user at any time.\\nDefinition 2 (Cloaked Circular Endpoint Privacy Zone).

Crucially, this attack is\\nenabled by the availability of exact accumulated and total distances\\nfor cloaked activities, revealing the distance traveled inside the\\nEPZ. The intuition behind our attack is that if a victim has multiple\\nactivities in one or more cardinal directions (which we denote as\\n‘entry gates’), we can use these distances to limit the locations\\nwhere the victim could have started or ended their activities. For\\nexample, consider the three activities in Figure 3 indicated in blue,\\norange and green. While only the owner of the activities can see\\nthe dashed portions of the activities inside the EPZ, the attacker\\nstill knows their lengths. With these lengths and given the street\\ngrid, an adversary is able to construct all paths the victim could\\nhave covered inside the EPZ. Given these paths, the endpoint of\\nthe activities is at risk of being inferred using the intersection\\nof multiple distinct paths inside the EPZ. We divide the breaking\\nof privacy zones into two subproblems: first, identifying EPZs to\\nreduce the search space, and second, finding the protected location\\ninside those EPZs through regression analysis.\\n4.1 Threat Model\\nFor this work, we consider an attacker who attempts to infer the\\nprotected locations of another user by only using the publicly avail-\\nable information that a regular user would be entitled to view, as\\ndisplayed by the FTSN. The adversary has exactly the same rights\\nas a regular user and cannot access any information by any other\\nmeans, e.g., by infiltrating the FTSN’s servers. The attacker can\\ntarget either one specific user or the entire userbase of the network.\\nThe attacker is reasonably technically sophisticated, capable of\\ninspecting network traffic to retrieve the activity metadata (e.g., in\\nbrowser developer tools), download map data and run the infer-\\nence algorithm. This attacker model is similar to that of Hassan\\net al. [24]. Mink et al. [35] consider a less technically skilled at-\\ntacker, who infers protected locations visually from the activity\\nview on the network’s website. In the context of intimate partner\\nviolence, Tseng et al. [52] found evidence of forum discussions\\nwhere users collaborate on technically sophisticated attacks. Given\\npossibly similar motivations to deanonymize protected locations\\n(e.g., stalking), even less technically skilled attackers could receive\\nsupport in successfully deploying the inference attack.\\n4.2 Identifying EPZs\\nAs a preliminary step for our attack, we seek to identify the EPZs of a\\nuser. This step resembles the attack developed by Hassan et al. [24],\\nwhere identifying the EPZ (by fitting a circle) reveals the protected\\nlocation. However, this is no longer sufficient for our inference\\nattack, as networks use EPZs with countermeasures against Hassan\\net al. ’s attack. In our case, this step is also not strictly necessary\\nfor our attack to be effective, as we can search candidate loca-\\ntions throughout the entire street grid regardless of the EPZ layout.\\nHowever, this step constrains the search space, which improves\\nthe attack’s efficacy and computational performance by remov-\\ning points that are ineligible as protected location. Moreover, if\\none search space contains multiple non-overlapping EPZs\\n1, our\\nregression-based approach for location discovery (see Algorithm 2)\\nmay return a location outside these EPZs, i.e., in fact ineligible to be\\na protected location. Some restriction is therefore advantageous, al-\\nthough it does not need to be precise. Nevertheless, with knowledge\\nof how EPZs are configured on a specific platform (see Section 3),\\nthe adversary can identify the distinct EPZs more precisely.\\nAs an example of an EPZ identification algorithm, we present\\nAlgorithm 1 that discovers circular EPZs. Such EPZs are used by\\nmost services (Table 1). This algorithm identifies multiple circular\\nEPZs, each with different protected locations and parameters, from\\nthe set 𝐴 of all cloaked activities of one user. The input to our\\nalgorithm is the set 𝑃 of all start points 𝑝𝑗 for cloaked activities\\nthat started inside an EPZ and all finish points𝑝𝑚 for activities that\\nended in an EPZ, as they are shown to the adversary (a non-owner\\nuser)2. We then adapt the 𝑘-means clustering algorithm [30] to\\noutput the distinct circular EPZ layouts based on these start and\\nfinish points, iteratively increasing𝑘until every EPZ is represented\\nby exactly one cluster. For a given 𝑘, the algorithm initializes 𝑘\\nclusters 𝑆𝑖 (𝑖 = 1,...,𝑘 ) with randomly selected points from 𝑃. In\\nsubsequent iterations, our algorithm assigns each point 𝑝 to the\\ncluster 𝑆𝑖 with the lowest Euclidean distance to the least squared\\ncircle 𝐶𝑖 fitted between the points of that cluster, and fitted such\\nthat none of the points lay inside𝐶𝑖 (a circular EPZ cloaks all points\\nwithin the circle, cf. Definition 2). This cost function differs from\\nregular k-means, where the distance from points to the mean of\\ntheir cluster is minimized. The radius of the fitted circle should be\\nbounded by the notion of the minimum and maximum radius of an\\n1In case the EPZs overlap, we consider the union as one EPZ with multiple protected\\nlocations. Bootstrapping the activities for the input to Algorithm 2 will then proba-\\nbilistically return these two locations (see also Section 6.2).\\n2Note that we convert the geodetic coordinates (latitude and longitude) from the FTSN\\nactivity data, to plane coordinates (Universal Transverse Mercator) by projecting them\\nonto a Cartesian plane, as established in Definition 1.\\n \\n804'),\n",

We generalize this to atotal distance sce-\\nnario in which only the combined cloaked distance is available,\\ni.e., without distinct distances for the start and finish point. If only\\none of the points lies inside a privacy zone (as could be inferred\\nusing Algorithm 1), the total distance trivially reduces to the inner\\ndistance, as this inner distance at the single cloaked side is equal to\\nthe reported distance discrepancy. Our data characteristics in Sec-\\ntion 5.2 show that 35.08% of activities only start or finish inside\\nan EPZ, but not both. When both endpoints are cloaked, there is\\nan unresolvable degree of freedom in the division of the distance\\ndiscrepancy over the start and finish points. In this case, the activ-\\nity is discarded, and the attack is run on the remaining activities.\\nOur analysis in Section 6.3 shows that our attack still performs\\nwell in this total distance scenario, with only a minor performance\\nreduction compared to the inner distance scenario.\\nIn an ideal context, the endpoints for the reported distances of\\nall activities would overlap at exactly one node of the road graph\\n(i.e., the protected location) if the following idealistic assumptions\\nwere to hold:\\nA1. The cloaked start and finish points intersect with the edge\\nof the EPZ.\\nA2. A protected location is always located along a path, i.e., on a\\nnode inside 𝐺.\\nA3. The victim starts and finishes their activity at the single\\nprotected location inside a distinct EPZ.\\nA4. Inside the EPZ, the victim uses the shortest path on the street\\ngrid from or to the protected location.\\nHowever, in practice these assumptions do not always hold. For\\nexample, a user might only start recording their activity 50 meters\\naway from their protected location, and GPS tracking errors will\\ncause a track to deviate from (the shortest path on) the street grid.\\nOverall, for a 200m EPZ, 54% of all activities in our real-world\\ndata set (Section 5) violate at least one idealistic assumption. Our\\napproach is explicitly designed to be robust against these violations,\\ni.e., it works even in non-ideal settings. We develop a four-step\\nalgorithm that provides a sufficiently correct solution even though\\nthese assumptions from the ideal context do not hold, as we show\\nin our real-world evaluation (Section 6).\\n4.3.1 Calculate Theoretical Distances. The algorithm starts by map\\nmatching (‘snapping’) all endpoints to the road graph. For each\\npoint 𝑝𝑙 ∈𝑃, the algorithm identifies the node𝑣𝑝𝑙 ∈𝑉 with the low-\\nest Euclidean distance 𝑑𝑝𝑙 to 𝑝𝑙. If this distance exceeds a threshold\\n𝜏𝑠𝑛𝑎𝑝, the algorithm discards this point since it is uncertain if the\\nroad was used. 𝜏𝑠𝑛𝑎𝑝 could be empirically selected based on the\\nmean GPS sampling distance. 𝑃′represents the set of map matched\\npoints 𝑣𝑝𝑙 that are retained. The algorithm then computes the short-\\nest path lengths from 𝑣𝑝𝑙 (recall: a point near the edge of the EPZ)\\nto all other nodes 𝑉 inside the EPZ using the Dijkstra single source\\nmultiple destination algorithm [16]. The lengths are collected into\\na distance matrix 𝑇 of size |𝑃′|×|𝑉|. These lengths represent the\\n‘theoretical’ distances from the cloaked map matched endpoints\\nat the edge of the EPZ to nodes within the EPZ (i.e., possible pro-\\ntected locations), if the track were to exactly follow the road graph.\\nHowever, GPS errors and the variation across the width of a road\\ncause the actual user tracks to deviate from this road graph.

No endpoints therefore lie inside the EPZ.\\nregression analysis in the last step of our algorithm addresses these\\ndeviations when predicting the protected location.\\n4.3.2 Identify Entry Gates. The exact intersection point of an activ-\\nity and the EPZ is seldom recoverable, violating Assumption A1. Def-\\ninition 1 states that the activity gets cut off at the first point out-\\nside the EPZ rather than at the exact intersection. In combination\\nwith low GPS sampling rates (to save battery) and GPS errors, this\\ncloaked endpoint can be distant from the edge of the EPZ, par-\\nticularly as the speed of an activity increases. Figure 5 shows an\\nexample of this scenario, where the endpoints of an activity do not\\nexactly intersect with the circular EPZ.\\nWe cluster the cloaked endpoints 𝑝𝑙 to form dense regions. We\\nrefer to these regions as entry gates, and we assume that each entry\\ngate 𝑌𝑗 consists of endpoints 𝑃𝑌𝑗 ⊆𝑃′where the intersection point\\nof the actual track with the edge of the EPZ is shared. In Figure 5,\\nthe points that form one entry gate are displayed in the same color.\\nThe most suitable algorithm for geospatial data is DBSCAN [19], a\\ndensity-based clustering algorithm, since it does not require a priori\\nknowledge of the number of clusters (i.e., entry gates).

Next, we discard outlier end-\\npoints that could incorrectly skew the prediction of the protected\\nlocation. Such outliers may stem from activities where the user\\nstarted or finished far away from the protected location (violating\\nAssumption A3), or did not follow the shortest path within the EPZ\\n(violating Assumption A4).\\nThe algorithm starts by discarding points 𝑣𝑝𝑙 with a reported\\ndistance 𝑜𝑙 larger than the maximum theoretical distance 𝑇𝑙,max\\nfrom 𝑣𝑝𝑙 to a node inside the EPZ, i.e., the maximum of the matrix\\nrow 𝑇𝑙,∗. We do this because these activities could never cover the\\nshortest path towards the protected location. For each entry gate\\n𝑌𝑗, our algorithm then discards outlier points where the reported\\ndistance deviates significantly from the distance for other points\\nwithin the same entry gate. Concretely, we consider a deviation of\\nmore than three standard deviations from the mean significant.\\n4.3.4 Predict Protected Location. As the points that constitute one\\nentry gate do not overlap exactly, we use least absolute deviation\\n(LAD) regression to predict the most likely protected location across\\nall these diffuse entry gates. For each node 𝑣𝑙 inside the EPZ (i.e.,\\neach possible protected location), the algorithm calculates the sum\\nof absolute differences across all points 𝑣𝑝𝑙 ∈𝑃′between the ob-\\nserved distance 𝑜𝑙 and the theoretical shortest path distance 𝑇𝑣𝑝𝑙,𝑣𝑙\\nbetween 𝑣𝑝𝑙 and 𝑣𝑙. The final predicted protected location is then the\\nnode 𝑣𝑙 ∈𝑉 where this sum is minimal. Note that we retain Assump-\\ntion A2 here, as the predicted location will always be located on the\\nroad graph. However, users may start or finish their activity away\\nfrom the road, e.g., on their private grounds. We offset this violation\\nof our assumption through the definition of an error threshold 𝜏𝑒,\\nbelow which the protected location is sufficiently closely predicted\\nto deanonymize the user. In Appendix A, we empirically determine\\nan acceptable error threshold based on real-world activities.\\n5 DATA COLLECTION\\nA large pool of real user data from a fitness tracking social network\\nis required to further evaluate the plausibility of our attack against\\nstate-of-the-art EPZ implementations. For this, we use Strava be-\\ncause it is one of the most popular fitness tracking social networks,\\nwith over four billion total activities recorded so far [49]. In this sec-\\ntion, we explain the methodology we used to collect user data from\\nStrava and further analyze this data set to obtain useful insights\\ninto the privacy habits of users and fitness trackers.\\n5.1 Methodology\\nThe scope of our data collection is a period of one week starting\\nfrom 11 July 2021. By inspecting timestamps and elapsed time of ac-\\ntivities, we conclude that IDs of activities are assigned sequentially\\nrather than randomly upon uploading. However, due to delays in\\nuploading activities to Strava, the temporal order is not sequential.\\nWe identify the first activity ID globally assigned after 11 July 2021\\n00:00 UTC. We then visit each next 9,000th public activity from\\napproximately 36 million activities uploaded during this week.

For this (public) activity, we identify the user who\\ncreated it. This ultimately provides us with a randomly generated,\\nrepresentative sample of 4,000 users.\\nFor each user in our sample, we retrieve user information (i.e.,\\nnationality) and the IDs of their public activities with map data. For\\nthis, we scrape and parse theoverview section of the athlete’s profile\\npage4 using Selenium [47]. Then, for each activity (ID), we extract\\nits total distance and type from the strava.com/activities/ID\\npage. We also collect the elevation profile including the GPS track\\npoints as coordinate pairs with the corresponding elevation and\\naccumulated distance data from the strava.com/stream/ID API\\nendpoint. Since an authenticated user can make a maximum of 375\\nrequests to Strava’s stream API per day, we use multiple accounts to\\nspeed up the download process. Despite downloading with multiple\\naccounts to circumvent rate limiting, our data set took three months\\nto collect. Before storing our collected data in our database, we\\npseudonymized the data by replacing original user IDs with an\\nautoincremented primary key upon request of our IRB. We repeat\\nthe same procedure for activity IDs.\\nTo obtain the road graph for each EPZ, we use the OSMnx frame-\\nwork [8] to download the OpenStreetMap road network in a graph\\nformat (see Figure 4a).\\n5.2 Data Characteristics\\nWith the aforementioned methodology, we collected a data set of\\n1,404,886 activities created by 4,000 users. We plot several distribu-\\ntions within this data set in Appendix B. The distribution of number\\nof activities per user is shown in Figure 11, with a median of 136\\nactivities per user. Our data set is geographically diverse as shown\\nin Figure 12, containing activity endpoints from 160 different coun-\\ntries. The data set provides different densities and layouts of road\\nnetworks, which is an important factor for the efficacy of our attack\\nas shown in Section 6.4.4.\\nWe observe that 461 users (11.53% of our total data set) use at\\nleast one EPZ to cloak activities. Figure 13 shows the distribution of\\nEPZ radii for these users, as determined through Algorithm 1 (with\\nparameters from Table 2a). Radii up to 400m have a 65.50% share,\\nindicating that smaller radii are more popular than larger ones.\\n35.08% of protected activities in our data have only one cloaked\\nendpoint, making them usable for the total distance scenario.

To do so, we use the 1,312,250\\nuncloaked5 activities generated by the 4,000 users in our data set\\n(Section 5). For each user, we search their activities that are part of\\nclusters of at least 15 endpoints that fall within 50 meters of one\\nanother. Since most fitness tracking social networks use an auto-\\ncomplete address form for the creation of privacy zones, we then\\ndesignate the streetside location of the closest address to these clus-\\nter’s centroids as our ground-truth location\\n𝑣𝐺𝑇 ∈𝑉 (i.e., the point\\nthat a user would configure as a protected location). We believe that\\ninferring likely protected locations from uncloaked activities is the\\nmost feasible way to generate a sufficiently large-scale yet reliable\\nground truth. We note that our approach to obtaining ground truth\\nis almost identical to that of the existing state of the art [24].\\nUsing the aforementioned methodology, we constructed 4,689\\nground-truth locations for 2,527 users (63.18 % of entire data set).\\nWe were unable to construct at least one reliable ground-truth\\nlocation for the other 1,473 users due to a lack of geographically\\nconcentrated, uncloaked activities of the Walk, Run or Ride type.\\n6.2 Prediction Evaluation\\nFor each ground-truth location, we synthesize an EPZ, with its\\ncenter randomly translated from that location, for each radius in\\nthe set of radii available in Strava. We consider this set of radii as\\nexemplar since Strava is one of the most popular FTSNs, and since\\nit supports the largest EPZ radii. In the case that multiple protected\\nlocations of the same user are located inside the same EPZ, i.e.,\\ncloser to each other than the EPZ radius (8% of 200m EPZs), we\\nonly synthesize an EPZ around the protected location with the\\nmost activity observations. We then simulate the cloaking of these\\n–previously uncloaked– activities by removing all points that fall\\nwithin the synthetic EPZ. Finally, we evaluate our attack by predict-\\ning the corresponding protected location of each (synthesized) EPZ\\nusing Algorithm 2 with the locally cloaked activity data as input.\\nWe then compare this prediction (i.e., the result of our algorithm)\\nwith the ground-truth location.\\nWe measure the predictive error of Algorithm 2 by construct-\\ning confidence intervals (CIs) using bootstrapping [18], a random\\nsampling method with replacement. We run our algorithm (using\\nthe parameters in Table 2b) 1000 times with resampled data from\\nthe observed activities 𝑎, retaining the original number of cloaked\\nactivities for this EPZ. This yields 1000 (not necessarily distinct) pre-\\ndicted locations 𝑉𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑑 ⊆𝑉, which we denote as the CI constructed\\nby bootstrapping. This finally allows us to estimate the probability\\ndistribution c𝑃𝑟(𝑣|𝑎), i.e., protected locations 𝑣 ∈𝑉 given the user’s\\nactivities 𝑎, with the probability quantified as the number of times\\nthe location was predicted out of the 1000 runs of our algorithm.\\nNote that this probability is, therefore, zero for locations that were\\nnever predicted, i.e., 𝑣𝑝 ∈𝑉𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑑 ⇔c𝑃𝑟(𝑣𝑝|𝑎)> 0.

First, we analyze whether FTSNs\\nleak sufficient distance metadata through their APIs to enable our\\nattack. Table 3 shows that the EPZ implementations of 3 and 5\\nfitness tracking social networks are vulnerable to our attacks in an\\ninner and total distance scenario (Section 4.3), respectively. Relive\\nis the only network that is never vulnerable to our attack, since\\nit enforces EPZs by truncating activities to only the track outside\\nthe EPZ when uploading. However, this truncation significantly\\nreduces usability (Section 7).\\nNext, we examine the efficacy of our attack with the privacy\\nmetrics from Section 6.2 on the collected data set from Section 5\\nagainst all radii in the studied radii set. The results for the inner\\ndistance and total distance scenario are shown in Tables 4 and 5\\n(Appendix C) respectively, and visualized altogether in Figure 6.\\nNote that, except for success rate, which is computed as a percentage\\nof binary success across all EPZs, we report the median across all\\nEPZs of the per-EPZ privacy metric values.\\nIn the inner distance scenario, we achieve a success rate of up\\nto 85% for EPZs with a radius of 200 m, the most popular option\\nacross Strava users (Figure 13). We notice a decrease in efficacy\\nof the attack as the EPZ radius increases, as depicted in Figure 6.\\nNevertheless, even for the largest radius (1600 m), we still success-\\nfully deanonymize 39% of protected locations. We achieve almost\\nidentical success rates for the total distance scenario.\\nFor larger radii, the number of nodes inside the EPZ (i.e., the\\ncandidate protected locations), as well as the number of nodes at\\nroughly the same distance from the entry gates of the EPZ increases.\\nThis leads to more confusion between candidate locations in our\\nLAD regression from Section 4.3.4, since more candidate nodes\\nhave similar distances.

Our attack achieves a success rate\\ncomparable to that of Hassan et al. ’s main attack which uses circle\\nfitting [24]. Hassan et al. report a global 84% success rate, and while\\ntheir results are not fully broken down by radius, they report a 44%\\nsuccess rate for 1 km radii. We achieve a success rate of up to 85%\\n(for 200 m radii) and a 55% success rate for 1 km radii. However,\\nour attack works for a harder-to-break EPZ implementation that\\nincludes spatial cloaking, for which Hassan et al. ’s main attack does\\nnot work, and we use a lower error threshold ( 𝜏𝑒 = 22.95 m for\\nus vs. 50 m for Hassan et al.). In addition, Hassan et al. proposed\\nspatial cloaking as a countermeasure, and evaluated an alternative\\ninterpolation attack on EPZs to which spatial cloaking has been\\napplied [24, Section 6.4]. Their attack relies only on route direction,\\nresulting in a success rate of at most 45% (for a radius of 200 m). Our\\nattack using regression across distance metadata performs up to two\\ntimes better (for similar radii) than Hassan et al. ’s alternative attack,\\nwith our attack having up to 85% success, again at a stricter error\\nthreshold. Therefore, we effectively circumvent the countermeasure\\nof Hassan et al. adopted by major FTSNs.\\nMink et al. [35] found that human users can infer up to 68% of\\nall sensitive locations in their data set, but again for the original\\nEPZ implementation without spatial cloaking and with a laxer error\\nthreshold. In comparison, our (automated) attack achieves a higher\\nsuccess rate and works on EPZs with spatial cloaking by leveraging\\ntopological information. While Mink et al. propose that humans\\nmay also use topological information for visual inference, we con-\\njecture that the need to visually trace the precise distances travelled\\nwithin the EPZ will make the visual inference task much less suc-\\ncessful at deanonymizing spatially cloaked protected locations than\\nour LAD regression.\\n6.4 Sensitivity Analysis\\nIn order to better understand the conditions in which our attack\\nperforms better or worse, and eventually develop more effective\\ncountermeasures, we now analyze attack performance when differ-\\nent factors are varied.\\n6.4.1 Suitable Activity Endpoints. We first analyze whether more\\nactivities and endpoints lead to better performance. As the number\\nof activity endpoints (i.e., observations for LAD regression in Sec-\\ntion 4.3.4) increases, the variance of the difference between observed\\nand theoretical distances for our prediction will decrease. More ac-\\ntivities contribute to a slightly higher success rate for predictions,\\nindependent of the EPZ radius, as Figure 7 indicates.\\n6.4.2 Entry Gates. An increased number of entry gates yields a\\nslightly higher success rate for smaller radii, as can be seen in Fig-\\nure 7. The effect for larger radii is nullified by users not taking the\\nshortest path. In fact, the geographic distribution of entry gates\\nhas a higher impact on the success rate of our predictions than the\\nnumber of entry gates.\\n6.4.3 Blind Spot Angle. We present the maximum blind spot angle\\nas a metric to measure this geographic distribution and define it as\\nthe maximum angle between entry gates relative to the center of\\nthe EPZ. Smaller blind spot angles provide more diversified obser-\\nvations for the LAD regression in Section 4.3.4 than observations\\nwithin one entry gate. These diverse observations increase the dif-\\nference between theoretical shortest path distances and observed\\ndistances of erroneous nodes, making it less likely that the LAD\\nregression selects the wrong locations. This explains the higher\\nsuccess rate, as can be seen in Figure 7.\\n6.4.4 Density of Road Network. As the EPZ radius increases, we\\nobserve an increasing negative effect of increased street density\\n(expressed as meters of road per square kilometer) on the success\\nrate of our predictions, as Figure 7 shows. As the density increases,\\nso does the number of nodes with the same distance from the entry\\ngates of the EPZ. This increased number of candidate nodes causes\\nconfusion in the LAD regression, resulting in larger confidence\\nintervals and the prediction of incorrect nodes which, in turn, has\\na negative influence on the success rate. Moreover, a denser road\\nnetwork gives the user more routes to take that are not the shortest\\npath, again violating Assumption A4.\\nAs one might expect for a distance-based attack, performance\\nprimarily depends on geographic factors. Increased geographic\\ndiversity in entry gates reduces confusion between candidate lo-\\ncations, particularly with sparser street grids and with smaller\\nmaximum blind spots. An increased number of activities is, there-\\nfore, only useful for our predictions if they introduce additional\\ngeographic disparity. Otherwise, their effect on the performance of\\nour attack is moderate.\\n7 COUNTERMEASURES\\nOur evaluation shows that identifying protected locations remains\\nfeasible with current EPZ implementations. While other privacy\\ndefenses exist, users tend to use these in combination with EPZs,\\nand users still find EPZs efficient [35]. In this section, we therefore\\ndevelop and evaluate potential countermeasures that support the\\ncontinued use of EPZs by making EPZs more resilient against our\\nattack. We evaluate our countermeasures on the inner distance\\nscenario of an EPZ with a radius of 400 meters. This inner dis-\\ntance scenario on a small radius is favorable from the adversary’s\\nviewpoint, yet accounts for the majority of EPZs in our data set as\\ndiscussed in Section 5.2. We also discuss the usability and privacy\\nimplications and trade-offs of our countermeasures.\\n7.1 Distance-Focused Countermeasures\\nOur attack primarily relies on the availability of the distance cov-\\nered within the EPZ. Countermeasures could seek to obfuscate\\nthese distances, in order to increase the error in our regression.\\nThis also has the effect of altering the total traveled distance.\\nC1 – Generalization. By reducing the precision of any reported\\ndistance shown to a non-owner user [51], the adversary would be\\nunable to reliably determine the distance between the actual and\\ncloaked start/finish points (whether inner or total distances). This\\nreduces the precision of the last step of Algorithm 2 (Section 4.3.4),\\nin which we search the point where the theoretical shortest path\\ndistances best correspond to the actually observed distances. We\\nimplement generalization by rounding distances to the nearest\\nmultiple of a certain integer value. In Figure 8, we evaluate the\\nperformance of our attack given different roundings of the inner\\n \\n810'),\n",

With the ground truth still\\npresent in the confidence interval, we observe no change in the\\nsuccess rate.\\nC3 – Shifting distances. The reported endpoints are shifted by a\\nfixed or random distance, while retaining the originally traveled dis-\\ntance as the total distance. However, similar to the noisy distances\\ncountermeasure, these random shifts may be averaged out across\\nactivities. In Figure 8, we see an increased uncertainty region of\\nthe adversary compared to the baseline. However, since the success\\nrate has not changed, 𝑘-anonymity has not been restored.\\nC4 – Truncation. A more invasive countermeasure consists of\\neliminating the track portions lying within the EPZ entirely, by not\\nincluding them in the reported total and accumulated distances,\\nor even hiding the full track. This would effectively thwart our\\nattack, as we can no longer infer where on the street grid inside\\nthe EPZ the activity may have started and ended; only a random\\nguess among all possible protected locations remains possible.\\nThe main disadvantage of altering the reported distances lies in\\ntheir negative usability impact. Whereas in other location-based\\nservices such as check-in apps, an error of several hundreds of\\nmeters may be acceptable [6], this may be less the case for fitness\\nsocial networks. Part of the attraction of these networks comes\\nfrom the gamification of exercise activities [7], such as achieve-\\nments for covering certain distance goals or being able to compare\\nacross small performance differences (in the order of seconds) [14],\\nwhich require high detail in activity data. Aggressive rounding\\nof distances would result in losing the desired precision at which\\nthe distance and pace are measured, possibly leading to overesti-\\nmated achievements.

This might also be why larger EPZ radii are less popular than\\nsmaller radii (as seen in our data set in Section 5.2).\\nC6 – Complex EPZs/cloaking. Beyond circular EPZs with a small\\nset of possible radii, different EPZ layouts could be implemented:\\ncircles with any radius or even any shape. Hassan et al. [24] pro-\\nposed a similar strategy by hiding a (small) track portion of random7\\nlength beyond the EPZ border (“Fuzz EPZ Intersection Points”). Al-\\nternatively, the concept of a ‘zone’ could be discarded, and instead\\na fixed or variable distance from the start and finish points could\\nbe cloaked, as Strava has recently implemented [32]. For our attack,\\nthis only affects the phase of identifying EPZs, as this step will\\nbe less reliable due to the noise applied to the cloaked endpoints.\\nAfterwards, the countermeasure has no effect on our location pre-\\ndiction algorithm: the inner/total distances and endpoints remain\\navailable, and allow for regression.\\nMore complex zones require more complex identification algo-\\nrithms, beyond the least squares fit for circular EPZs (Algorithm 1).\\nThese algorithms may be less accurate at identifying EPZs. More\\ncomplex zones may also make the removal of deviating activities\\n(Section 4.3.3) less effective, as the threshold for becoming an outlier\\nbecomes less likely to be met. However, as stated in Section 4.2,\\nour attack still works with imprecise EPZ identification. Counter-\\nmeasures that make EPZ discovery harder, therefore, cannot fully\\nthwart our attack. Crucially, these countermeasures do not affect\\nthe availability nor accuracy of the reported distances. Any increase\\nin the search space due to a less compact EPZ will reduce the attack\\nperformance by increasing the likelihood that an erroneous loca-\\ntion is predicted, and it will make the attack more computationally\\nexpensive.\\nFinally, a number of apparent countermeasures may seem effec-\\ntive at first, but can potentially improve the efficacy of our attack.\\nRegeneration of an EPZ recomputes the endpoints for every (future)\\nactivity, and may, therefore, generate additional entry gates, as the\\nedge of the EPZ has now shifted. This yields additional and more\\ndiverse data, which could improve the correctness of our attack,\\nsince our evaluation in Section 6.4 shows that correctness tends\\nto decrease when there are more entry gates and activities. Next,\\nsmoothing the track by map matching nodes to the road network\\nwould remove any (small) deviations that cause the actual traveled\\ndistance to not match the theoretical shortest path exactly, and\\nwould, therefore, make the LAD regression step more accurate.\\nIn summary, distance-based countermeasures and in particular\\ngeneralization are the most effective, but can severely reduce usabil-\\nity. Countermeasures that target EPZ discovery are less invasive,\\nbut only partially prevent our attack.\\n8 RELATED WORK\\nTwo recent works have analyzed vulnerabilities in previous imple-\\nmentations of EPZs where no spatial cloaking was applied and the\\ncenter of the EPZ was therefore the protected location. In 2018,\\nHassan et al. [24] were able to infer EPZs and their protected loca-\\ntions by fitting circles between pairs of endpoints. They identified\\n84% of 432,022 athletes across 2.3 million EPZ-enabled Strava ac-\\ntivities. In 2022, Mink et al. [35] showed that users could visually\\n7A fixed shift would be equivalent to increasing the EPZ radius.\\nidentify up to 68% of protected locations when asked to draw the\\nEPZ between activity endpoints overlaid on a map and pinpoint the\\nprotected location. Hassan et al. [24] proposed several countermea-\\nsures, which were implemented by some fitness tracking networks.\\nCrucially, both works therefore only prove the vulnerability of\\nan EPZ implementation that is by now arguably outdated. In con-\\ntrast to both works, our attack breaks the current state-of-the-art\\nEPZs, i.e., those when spatial cloaking is present, with a comparable\\nor higher success rate than the prior work, on a harder-to-break\\nEPZ implementation. We also analyze in depth to which factors of\\nprivacy zones our attack is sensitive.\\nOther work has explored other privacy concerns in sharing loca-\\ntion data on fitness tracking social networks. Beyond privacy zones,\\nMeteriz et al. [34] found that elevation profiles could be sufficient\\nto recover a location at borough- or city-level, even if the location\\ndata is not shared. They require prior knowledge of potentially vis-\\nited locations, which are predicted at very low granularity, unlike\\nour attack. Alqhatani and Lipfore [2], Zimmer et al. [56], Gabriele\\nand Chiasson [20], Couture [14], and Mink et al. [35] described\\nhow users are somewhat aware of the privacy implications of shar-\\ning location data on fitness tracking social networks, but that this\\nawareness may be insufficient. They also found that users differ\\nin their sensitivity to having sensitive locations publicly available,\\ncorrelating with concerns on personal space and physical safety.\\nMink et al.

[29] developed attacks for three popular location proximity\\nservices, accurate to up to 25 meters. Argyros et al.

We disclosed our findings to the affected parties from Table 3\\nby sending them a draft of this manuscript and by formulating\\nrecommendations for improving the privacy of their users.\\n10 CONCLUSION\\nMajor fitness tracking social networks have introduced endpoint\\nprivacy zones as a tool to protect sensitive locations from being\\nrevealed to malicious actors. However, despite the usage of spa-\\ntial cloaking, we show that these protected locations can still be\\ndiscovered reliably. Our attack leverages the reported distances\\ntraveled within the EPZ, as well as the layout of the street grid\\nto deanonymize protected locations with a success rate of up to\\n85%. While distance-based countermeasures such as generalization\\ncan be effective at thwarting our attack, they can also severely re-\\nduce usability. Networks must, therefore, carefully consider which\\nfunctionality they provide while guaranteeing user privacy.\\n11 ADDENDUM: SPATIAL CERTAINTY\\nWe design a new metric to measure spatial certainty, which rep-\\nresents the geographical closeness of predictions. For example,\\nconsider two situations (a) and (b), depicted in Figure 9, where an\\nattacker predicts four locations inside an EPZ with uniform proba-\\nbility. Whereas the predictions in (a) are geographically dispersed,\\nthe predictions in (b) are geographically concentrated.\\nShokri [46] defined certainty as the Shannon entropy [44] of\\nthe estimate probability distribution c𝑃𝑟(𝑣|𝑎).

This will make it harder for an\\nattacker to pinpoint a single solution𝑣𝑝 ∈𝑉𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑑. However, we only\\nclaim to predict a location with 𝜏𝑒 precision. Therefore, we should\\nconsider neighborhoods of nodes within 𝜏𝑒 when determining if a\\nprediction is sufficiently close to the protected location.\\nWe additionally define spatial certainty as Karlstrom and Cec-\\ncato’s entropy [26].

subcontinent between 73,000 and 55,000 years ago.[1] The earliest known human remains in South Asia date to 30,000 years ago. Sedentariness began in South Asia around 7000 BCE; by 4500 BCE, settled life had spread,[2] and gradually evolved into the Indus Valley Civilisation, one of three early cradles of civilisation in the Old World,[3][4] which flourished between 2500 BCE and 1900 BCE in present-day Pakistan and north-western India. Early in the second millennium BCE, persistent drought caused the population of the Indus Valley to scatter from large urban centres to villages. Indo-Aryan tribes moved into the Punjab from Central Asia in several waves of migration. The Vedic Period of the Vedic people in northern India (1500–500 BCE) was marked by the composition of their extensive collections of hymns (Vedas). The social structure was loosely stratified via the varna system, incorporated into the highly evolved present-day Jāti system. The pastoral and nomadic Indo-Aryans spread from the Punjab into the Gangetic plain. Around 600 BCE, a new, interregional culture arose; then, small chieftaincies (janapadas) were consolidated into larger states (mahajanapadas). Second urbanization took place, which came with the rise of new ascetic movements and religious concepts,[5] including the rise of Jainism and Buddhism. The latter was synthesized with the preexisting religious cultures of the subcontinent, giving rise to Hinduism.\\n\\nIndian cultural influence (Greater India)\\nTimeline of Indian history\\nChandragupta Maurya overthrew the Nanda Empire and established the first great empire in ancient India, the Maurya Empire. India\\'s Mauryan king Ashoka is widely recognised for the violent kalinga war and his historical acceptance of Buddhism and his attempts to spread nonviolence and peace across his empire. The Maurya Empire would collapse in 185 BCE, on the assassination of the then-emperor Brihadratha by his general Pushyamitra Shunga. Shunga would form the Shunga Empire in the north and north-east of the subcontinent, while the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom would claim the north-west and found the Indo-Greek Kingdom. Various parts of India were ruled by numerous dynasties, including the Gupta Empire, in the 4th to 6th centuries CE. This period, witnessing a Hindu religious and intellectual resurgence is known as the Classical or Golden Age of India. Aspects of Indian civilisation, administration, culture, and religion spread to much of Asia, which led to the establishment of Indianised kingdoms in the region, forming Greater India.[6][5] The most significant event between the 7th and 11th centuries was the Tripartite struggle centred on Kannauj. Southern India saw the rise of multiple imperial powers from the middle of the fifth century. The Chola dynasty conquered southern India in the 11th century. In the early medieval period, Indian mathematics, including Hindu numerals, influenced the development of mathematics and astronomy in the Arab world, including the creation of the Hindu-Arabic numeral system.[7]\\nIslamic conquests made limited inroads into modern Afghanistan and Sindh as early as the 8th century,[8] followed by the invasions of Mahmud Ghazni.[9]\\nThe Delhi Sultanate, established in 1206 by Central Asian Turks, ruled much of northern India in the 14th century. It was governed by various Turkic and Afghan dynasties, including the Indo-Turkic Tughlaqs.[10][11] The empire declined in the late 14th century following the invasions of Timur[12] and saw the advent of the Malwa, Gujarat, and Bahmani sultanates, the last of which split in 1518 into the five Deccan sultanates. The wealthy Bengal Sultanate also emerged as a major power, lasting over three centuries.[13] During this period, multiple strong Hindu kingdoms, notably the Vijayanagara Empire and Rajput states under the Kingdom of Mewar emerged and played significant roles in shaping the cultural and political landscape of India.[14][15]\\nThe early modern period began in the 16th century, when the Mughal Empire conquered most of the Indian subcontinent,[16] signaling the proto-industrialisation, becoming the biggest global economy and manufacturing power.[17][18][19] The Mughals suffered a gradual decline in the early 18th century, largely due to the rising power of the Marathas, who took control of extensive regions of the Indian subcontinent, and numerous Afghan invasions.[20][21][22] The East India Company, acting as a sovereign force on behalf of the British government, gradually acquired control of huge areas of India between the middle of the 18th and the middle of the 19th centuries. Policies of company rule in India led to the Indian Rebellion of 1857. India was afterwards ruled directly by the British Crown, in the British Raj. After World War I, a nationwide struggle for independence was launched by the Indian National Congress, led by Mahatma Gandhi. Later, the All-India Muslim League would advocate for a separate Muslim-majority nation state. The British Indian Empire was partitioned in August 1947 into the Dominion of India and Dominion of Pakistan, each gaining its independence.\\n\\n\\n Prehistoric era (before c. 3300 BCE)\\nThis section contains too many or overly lengthy quotations.

Although the rock art has not been directly dated,[23] it has been argued on circumstantial grounds that many paintings were completed by 8000 BCE,[24] and some slightly earlier.[25]A dolmen erected by Neolithic people in Marayur, Kerala, India.Stone Age (6,000\\xa0BCE) carvings of Edakkal Caves in Kerala, India.\\nPaleolithic\\nMain article: South Asian Stone AgeHominin expansion from Africa is estimated to have reached the Indian subcontinent approximately two million years ago, and possibly as early as 2.2 million years ago.[26][27][28] This dating is based on the known presence of Homo erectus in Indonesia by 1.8 million years ago and in East Asia by 1.36 million years ago, as well as the discovery of stone tools at Riwat in Pakistan.[27][29] Although some older discoveries have been claimed, the suggested dates, based on the dating of fluvial sediments, have not been independently verified.[28][30]\\nThe oldest hominin fossil remains in the Indian subcontinent are those of Homo erectus or Homo heidelbergensis, from the Narmada Valley in central India, and are dated to approximately half a million years ago.[27][30] Older fossil finds have been claimed, but are considered unreliable.[30] Reviews of archaeological evidence have suggested that occupation of the Indian subcontinent by hominins was sporadic until approximately 700,000 years ago, and was geographically widespread by approximately 250,000 years ago.[30][28]\\n\\nAccording to a historical demographer of South Asia, Tim Dyson:Modern human beings—Homo sapiens—originated in Africa. Then, intermittently, sometime between 60,000 and 80,000 years ago, tiny groups of them began to enter the north-west of the Indian subcontinent. It seems likely that initially they came by way of the coast. It is virtually certain that there were Homo sapiens in the subcontinent 55,000 years ago, even though the earliest fossils that have been found of them date to only about 30,000 years before the present.[31]\\nAccording to Michael D. Petraglia and Bridget Allchin: Y-Chromosome and Mt-DNA data support the colonisation of South Asia by modern humans originating in Africa. ... Coalescence dates for most non-European populations average to between 73–55 ka.[32]\\nHistorian of South Asia, Michael H. Fisher, states: Scholars estimate that the first successful expansion of the Homo sapiens range beyond Africa and across the Arabian Peninsula occurred from as early as 80,000 years ago to as late as 40,000 years ago, although there may have been prior unsuccessful emigrations. Some of their descendants extended the human range ever further in each generation, spreading into each habitable land they encountered. One human channel was along the warm and productive coastal lands of the Persian Gulf and northern Indian Ocean. Eventually, various bands entered India between 75,000 years ago and 35,000 years ago.[33]\\nArchaeological evidence has been interpreted to suggest the presence of anatomically modern humans in the Indian subcontinent 78,000–74,000 years ago,[34] although this interpretation is disputed.[35][36] The occupation of South Asia by modern humans, initially in varying forms of isolation as hunter-gatherers, has turned it into a highly diverse one, second only to Africa in human genetic diversity.[37]\\n\\nAccording to Tim Dyson: Genetic research has contributed to knowledge of the prehistory of the subcontinent\\'s people in other respects. In particular, the level of genetic diversity in the region is extremely high. Indeed, only Africa\\'s population is genetically more diverse. Related to this, there is strong evidence of \\'founder\\' events in the subcontinent. By this is meant circumstances where a subgroup—such as a tribe—derives from a tiny number of \\'original\\' individuals. Further, compared to most world regions, the subcontinent\\'s people are relatively distinct in having practised comparatively high levels of endogamy.[37]\\nNeolithic\\nMehrgarh site in present-day Balochistan, Pakistan\\nMehrgarh painted pottery, 3000–2500 BCE[38]\\nSettled life emerged on the subcontinent in the western margins of the Indus River alluvium approximately 9,000 years ago, evolving gradually into the Indus Valley Civilisation of the third millennium BCE.[2][39] According to Tim Dyson: \"By 7,000 years ago agriculture was firmly established in Baluchistan... [and] slowly spread eastwards into the Indus valley.\" Michael Fisher adds:[40] The earliest discovered instance ... of well-established, settled agricultural society is at Mehrgarh in the hills between the Bolan Pass and the Indus plain (today in Pakistan) (see Map 3.1). From as early as 7000 BCE, communities there started investing increased labor in preparing the land and selecting, planting, tending, and harvesting particular grain-producing plants. They also domesticated animals, including sheep, goats, pigs, and oxen (both humped zebu [Bos indicus] and unhumped [Bos taurus]). Castrating oxen, for instance, turned them from mainly meat sources into domesticated draft-animals as well.[40]\\nBronze Age (c. 3300 – 1800 BCE)\\nIndus Valley Civilisation\\nMain article: Indus Valley Civilisation\\nSee also: List of Indus Valley Civilisation sites\\nHarappan Period at peak, c. 2600 – 1900 BCE\\nThe Bronze Age in the Indian subcontinent began around 3300\\xa0BCE.[citation needed] The Indus Valley region was one of three early cradles of civilisation in the Old World; the Indus Valley civilisation was the most expansive,[3] and at its peak, may have had a population of over five million.[4]\\nThe civilisation was primarily centred in modern-day Pakistan, in the Indus river basin, and secondarily in the Ghaggar-Hakra River basin. The mature Indus civilisation flourished from about 2600 to 1900\\xa0BCE, marking the beginning of urban civilisation on the Indian subcontinent. It included cities such as Harappa, Ganweriwal, and Mohenjo-daro in modern-day Pakistan, and Dholavira, Kalibangan, Rakhigarhi, and Lothal in modern-day India.\\n\\nMohenjo-daro (one of the largest Indus cities).

The civilisation also developed an Indus script, the earliest of the ancient Indian scripts, which is presently undeciphered.[43] This is the reason why Harappan language is not directly attested, and its affiliation is uncertain.[44]\\n\\nThree stamp seals and their impressions showing Indus script characters alongside animals: unicorn (left), bull (centre), and elephant (right); at Guimet Museum \\nAfter the collapse of Indus Valley civilisation, the inhabitants migrated from the river valleys of Indus and Ghaggar-Hakra, towards the Himalayan foothills of Ganga-Yamuna basin.[45]\\n\\nOchre Coloured Pottery culture\\nSinauli solid-disk wheel cart, photograph of the Archaeological Survey of India.[46]\\nDuring the 2nd millennium\\xa0BCE, Ochre Coloured Pottery culture was in Ganga Yamuna Doab region. These were rural settlements with agriculture and hunting. They were using copper tools such as axes, spears, arrows, and swords, and had domesticated animals.[47]\\n\\nIron Age (c. 1800 – 200 BCE)\\nSee also: Iron Age in India\\nVedic period (c. 1500 – 600 BCE)\\nMain articles: Vedic period, Historical Vedic religion, and Vedas\\nSee also: Indo-Aryan peoples and Indo-Aryan migrations\\nStarting c.\\u20091900\\xa0BCE, Indo-Aryan tribes moved into the Punjab from Central Asia in several waves of migration.[48][49] The Vedic period is when the Vedas were composed of liturgical hymns from the Indo-Aryan people. The Vedic culture was located in part of north-west India, while other parts of India had a distinct cultural identity. Many regions of the Indian subcontinent transitioned from the Chalcolithic to the Iron Age in this period.[50]\\nThe Vedic culture is described in the texts of Vedas, still sacred to Hindus, which were orally composed and transmitted in Vedic Sanskrit. The Vedas are some of the oldest extant texts in India.[51] The Vedic period, lasting from about 1500 to 500\\xa0BCE,[52][53] contributed to the foundations of several cultural aspects of the Indian subcontinent.\\n\\nVedic society\\nAn early 19th century manuscript in the Devanagari script of the Rigveda, originally transmitted orally[54]\\nHistorians have analysed the Vedas to posit a Vedic culture in the Punjab, and the upper Gangetic Plain.[50] The Peepal tree and cow were sanctified by the time of the Atharva Veda.[55] Many of the concepts of Indian philosophy espoused later, like dharma, trace their roots to Vedic antecedents.[56]\\nEarly Vedic society is described in the Rigveda, the oldest Vedic text, believed to have been compiled during the 2nd millennium BCE,[57][58] in the north-western region of the Indian subcontinent.[59] At this time, Aryan society consisted of predominantly tribal and pastoral groups, distinct from the Harappan urbanisation which had been abandoned.[60] The early Indo-Aryan presence probably corresponds, in part, to the Ochre Coloured Pottery culture in archaeological contexts.[61][62]\\nAt the end of the Rigvedic period, the Aryan society expanded from the north-western region of the Indian subcontinent into the western Ganges plain. It became increasingly agricultural and was socially organised around the hierarchy of the four varnas, or social classes.[63] This social structure was characterised by the exclusion of some indigenous peoples by labelling their occupations impure.[64] During this period, many of the previous small tribal units and chiefdoms began to coalesce into Janapadas (monarchical, state-level polities).[65]\\n\\nSanskrit epics\\nMain articles: Mahabharata and Ramayana\\nSee also: List of historic Indian texts and List of Hindu texts\\nManuscript illustration of the Battle of Kurukshetra.\\nThe Sanskrit epics Ramayana and Mahabharata were composed during this period.[66] The Mahabharata remains the longest single poem in the world.[67] Historians formerly postulated an \"epic age\" as the milieu of these two epic poems, but now recognise that the texts went through multiple stages of development over centuries.[68] The existing texts of these epics are believed to belong to the post-Vedic age, between c. 400\\xa0BCE and 400\\xa0CE.[68][69]\\n\\nJanapadas\\nMain article: Janapada\\nSee also: Battle of the Ten Kings and List of ancient Indo-Aryan peoples and tribes\\nLate Vedic era map showing the boundaries of Āryāvarta with Janapadas in northern India, beginning of Iron Age kingdoms in India – Kuru, Panchala, Kosala, Videha \\nThe Iron Age in the Indian subcontinent from about 1200\\xa0BCE to the 6th century BCE is defined by the rise of Janapadas, which are realms, republics and kingdoms—notably the Iron Age Kingdoms of Kuru, Panchala, Kosala and Videha.[70][71]\\nThe Kuru Kingdom (c. 1200–450 BCE) was the first state-level society of the Vedic period, corresponding to the beginning of the Iron Age in north-western India, around 1200–800\\xa0BCE,[72] as well as with the composition of the Atharvaveda.[73] The Kuru state organised the Vedic hymns into collections and developed the srauta ritual to uphold the social order.[73] Two key figures of the Kuru state were king Parikshit and his successor Janamejaya, who transformed this realm into the dominant political, social, and cultural power of northern India.[73] When the Kuru kingdom declined, the centre of Vedic culture shifted to their eastern neighbours, the Panchala kingdom.[73] The archaeological PGW (Painted Grey Ware) culture, which flourished in north-eastern India\\'s Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh regions from about 1100 to 600\\xa0BCE,[61] is believed to correspond to the Kuru and Panchala kingdoms.[73][74]\\nDuring the Late Vedic Period, the kingdom of Videha emerged as a new centre of Vedic culture, situated even farther to the East (in what is today Nepal and Bihar state);[62] reaching its prominence under the king Janaka, whose court provided patronage for Brahmin sages and philosophers such as Yajnavalkya, Aruni, and Gārgī Vāchaknavī.[75] The later part of this period corresponds with a consolidation of increasingly large states and kingdoms, called Mahajanapadas, across Northern India.\\n\\nSecond urbanisation (c. 600 – 200 BCE)\\nCity of Kushinagar in the 5th century BCE according to a 1st-century BCE frieze in Sanchi Stupa 1 Southern Gate\\nThe period between 800 and 200\\xa0BCE saw the formation of the Śramaṇa movement, from which Jainism and Buddhism originated. The first Upanishads were written during this period. After 500\\xa0BCE, the so-called \"second urbanisation\"[note 1] started, with new urban settlements arising at the Ganges plain.[77] The foundations for the \"second urbanisation\" were laid prior to 600 BCE, in the Painted Grey Ware culture of the Ghaggar-Hakra and Upper Ganges Plain; although most PGW sites were small farming villages, \"several dozen\" PGW sites eventually emerged as relatively large settlements that can be characterised as towns, the largest of which were fortified by ditches or moats and embankments made of piled earth with wooden palisades.[78]\\nThe Central Ganges Plain, where Magadha gained prominence, forming the base of the Maurya Empire, was a distinct cultural area,[79] with new states arising after 500\\xa0BCE.[80][81] It was influenced by the Vedic culture,[82] but differed markedly from the Kuru-Panchala region.[83] It \"was the area of the earliest known cultivation of rice in South Asia and by 1800 BCE was the location of an advanced Neolithic population associated with the sites of Chirand and Chechar\".[84] In this region, the Śramaṇic movements flourished, and Jainism and Buddhism originated.[74]\\n\\nBuddhism and Jainism\\nMain articles: Upanishads and Śramaṇa\\nFurther information: History of Hinduism, History of Buddhism, History of Jainism, Indian religions, and Indian philosophy\\nUpanishads and Śramaṇa movementsA page of Isha Upanishad manuscript.Mahavira, the 24th and last Tirthankara of Jainism.Gautama Buddha\\'s cremation stupa, Kushinagar (Kushinara).\\nThe time between 800\\xa0BCE and 400\\xa0BCE witnessed the composition of the earliest Upanishads,[85][86][87] which form the theoretical basis of classical Hinduism, and are also known as the Vedanta (conclusion of the Vedas).[88]\\nThe increasing urbanisation of India in the 7th and 6th centuries BCE led to the rise of new ascetic or \"Śramaṇa movements\" which challenged the orthodoxy of rituals.[85] Mahavira (c. 599–527\\xa0BCE), proponent of Jainism, and Gautama Buddha (c. 563–483\\xa0BCE), founder of Buddhism, were the most prominent icons of this movement. Śramaṇa gave rise to the concept of the cycle of birth and death, the concept of samsara, and the concept of liberation.[89] Buddha found a Middle Way that ameliorated the extreme asceticism found in the Śramaṇa religions.[90]\\nAround the same time, Mahavira (the 24th Tirthankara in Jainism) propagated a theology that was to later become Jainism.[91] However, Jain orthodoxy believes the teachings of the Tirthankaras predates all known time and scholars believe Parshvanatha (c. 872 – c. 772\\xa0BCE), accorded status as the 23rd Tirthankara, was a historical figure. The Vedas are believed to have documented a few Tirthankaras and an ascetic order similar to the Śramaṇa movement.[92]\\n\\nMahajanapadas\\nMain article: Mahajanapadas\\nThe Mahajanapadas were sixteen powerful polities located mainly within the Indo-Gangetic Plain \\nThe period from c.\\u2009600\\xa0BCE to c.\\u2009300\\xa0BCE featured the rise of the Mahajanapadas, sixteen powerful kingdoms and oligarchic republics in a belt stretching from Gandhara in the north-west to Bengal in the eastern part of the Indian subcontinent—including parts of the trans-Vindhyan region.[93] Ancient Buddhist texts, like the Aṅguttara Nikāya,[94] make frequent reference to these sixteen great kingdoms and republics—Anga, Assaka, Avanti, Chedi, Gandhara, Kashi, Kamboja, Kosala, Kuru, Magadha, Malla, Matsya (or Machcha), Panchala, Surasena, Vṛji, and Vatsa. This period saw the second major rise of urbanism in India after the Indus Valley Civilisation.[95]\\n\\nHindush warrior, on the Tomb of Xerxes I, circa 480 BCE.\\nEarly \"republics\" or gaṇasaṅgha,[96] such as Shakyas, Koliyas, Mallakas, and Licchavis had republican governments. Gaṇasaṅghas,[96] such as the Mallakas, centered in the city of Kusinagara, and the Vajjika League, centred in the city of Vaishali, existed as early as the 6th century BCE and persisted in some areas until the 4th century CE.[97] The most famous clan amongst the ruling confederate clans of the Vajji Mahajanapada were the Licchavis.[98]\\nThis period corresponds in an archaeological context to the Northern Black Polished Ware culture. Especially focused in the Central Ganges plain but also spreading across vast areas of the northern and central Indian subcontinent, this culture is characterised by the emergence of large cities with massive fortifications, significant population growth, increased social stratification, wide-ranging trade networks, construction of public architecture and water channels, specialised craft industries, a system of weights, punch-marked coins, and the introduction of writing in the form of Brahmi and Kharosthi scripts.[99][100] The language of the gentry at that time was Sanskrit, while the languages of the general population of northern India are referred to as Prakrits.\\nMany of the sixteen kingdoms had merged into four major ones by the time of Gautama Buddha. These four were Vatsa, Avanti, Kosala, and Magadha.[95]\\n\\nEarly Magadha dynasties\\nMain articles: Magadha and Greater Magadha\\nSee also: Magadha period, Pradyota dynasty, Haryanka dynasty, and Shaishunaga dynasty\\nMagadha state c. 600\\xa0BCE, which is later expanded from its capital Rajagriha – under the Haryanka dynasty and the later Shishunaga dynasty.\\nMagadha formed one of the sixteen Mahajanapadas (Sanskrit: \"Great Realms\") or kingdoms in ancient India. The core of the kingdom was the area of Bihar south of the Ganges; its first capital was Rajagriha (modern Rajgir) then Pataliputra (modern Patna). Magadha expanded to include most of Bihar and Bengal with the conquest of Licchavi and Anga respectively,[101] followed by much of eastern Uttar Pradesh and Orissa. The ancient kingdom of Magadha is heavily mentioned in Jain and Buddhist texts. It is also mentioned in the Ramayana, Mahabharata and Puranas.[102] The earliest reference to the Magadha people occurs in the Atharva-Veda where they are found listed along with the Angas, Gandharis, and Mujavats. Magadha played an important role in the development of Jainism and Buddhism. Republican communities (such as the community of Rajakumara) are merged into Magadha kingdom. Villages had their own assemblies under their local chiefs called Gramakas. Their administrations were divided into executive, judicial, and military functions.\\nEarly sources, from the Buddhist Pāli Canon, the Jain Agamas and the Hindu Puranas, mention Magadha being ruled by the Pradyota dynasty and Haryanka dynasty (c. 544–413 BCE) for some 200 years, c. 600–413\\xa0BCE. King Bimbisara of the Haryanka dynasty led an active and expansive policy, conquering Anga in what is now eastern Bihar and West Bengal. King Bimbisara was overthrown and killed by his son, Prince Ajatashatru, who continued the expansionist policy of Magadha. During this period, Gautama Buddha, the founder of Buddhism, lived much of his life in the Magadha kingdom. He attained enlightenment in Bodh Gaya, gave his first sermon in Sarnath and the first Buddhist council was held in Rajgriha.[103] The Haryanka dynasty was overthrown by the Shaishunaga dynasty (c. 413–345 BCE). The last Shishunaga ruler, Kalasoka, was assassinated by Mahapadma Nanda in 345\\xa0BCE, the first of the so-called Nine Nandas (Mahapadma Nanda and his eight sons).\\n\\nNanda Empire and Alexander\\'s campaign\\nMain article: Nanda Empire\\nSee also: Indian campaign of Alexander the Great\\nThe Nanda Empire (c. 345–322 BCE), at its peak, extended from Bengal in the east, to the Punjab in the west and as far south as the Vindhya Range.[104] The Nanda dynasty built on the foundations laid by their Haryanka and Shishunaga predecessors.[105] Nanda empire have built a vast army, consisting of 200,000 infantry, 20,000 cavalry, 2,000 war chariots and 3,000 war elephants (at the lowest estimates).[106][107]\\n\\nMaurya Empire\\nMain article: Maurya Empire\\nMaurya EmpireMaurya Empire at its peak under Ashoka the Great.Ashokan pillar at Vaishali, 3rd century BCE.\\nThe Maurya Empire (322–185\\xa0BCE) unified most of the Indian subcontinent into one state, and was the largest empire ever to exist on the Indian subcontinent.[108] At its greatest extent, the Mauryan Empire stretched to the north up to the natural boundaries of the Himalayas and to the east into what is now Assam. To the west, it reached beyond modern Pakistan, to the Hindu Kush mountains in what is now Afghanistan. The empire was established by Chandragupta Maurya assisted by Chanakya (Kautilya) in Magadha (in modern Bihar) when he overthrew the Nanda Empire.[109]\\nChandragupta rapidly expanded his power westwards across central and western India, and by 317\\xa0BCE the empire had fully occupied north-western India. The Mauryan Empire defeated Seleucus I, founder of the Seleucid Empire, during the Seleucid–Mauryan war, thus gained additional territory west of the Indus River. Chandragupta\\'s son Bindusara succeeded to the throne around 297\\xa0BCE. By the time he died in c. 272\\xa0BCE, a large part of the Indian subcontinent was under Mauryan suzerainty. However, the region of Kalinga (around modern day Odisha) remained outside Mauryan control, perhaps interfering with trade with the south.[110]\\n\\nThe Mauryan carved door of Lomas Rishi, one of the Barabar Caves, c. 250 BCE\\nBindusara was succeeded by Ashoka, whose reign lasted until his death in about 232\\xa0BCE.[111] His campaign against the Kalingans in about 260\\xa0BCE, though successful, led to immense loss of life and misery. This led Ashoka to shun violence, and subsequently to embrace Buddhism.[110] The empire began to decline after his death and the last Mauryan ruler, Brihadratha, was assassinated by Pushyamitra Shunga to establish the Shunga Empire.[111]\\nUnder Chandragupta Maurya and his successors, internal and external trade, agriculture, and economic activities all thrived and expanded across India thanks to the creation of a single efficient system of finance, administration, and security. The Mauryans built the Grand Trunk Road, one of Asia\\'s oldest and longest major roads connecting the Indian subcontinent with Central Asia.[112] After the Kalinga War, the Empire experienced nearly half a century of peace and security under Ashoka. Mauryan India also enjoyed an era of social harmony, religious transformation, and expansion of scientific knowledge. Chandragupta Maurya\\'s embrace of Jainism increased social and religious renewal and reform across his society, while Ashoka\\'s embrace of Buddhism has been said to have been the foundation of the reign of social and political peace and non-violence across India.[citation needed] Ashoka sponsored Buddhist missions across the Indo-Mediterranean, into Sri Lanka, Southeast Asia, West Asia, North Africa, and Mediterranean Europe.[113]\\nThe Arthashastra written by Chanakya and the Edicts of Ashoka are the primary written records of the Mauryan times. Archaeologically, this period falls in the era of Northern Black Polished Ware. The Mauryan Empire was based on a modern and efficient economy and society in which the sale of merchandise was closely regulated by the government.[114] Although there was no banking in the Mauryan society, usury was customary. A significant amount of written records on slavery are found, suggesting a prevalence thereof.[115] During this period, a high-quality steel called Wootz steel was developed in south India and was later exported to China and Arabia.[116]\\n\\nSangam period\\nMain articles: Sangam period, Sources of ancient Tamil history, Sangam literature, and Five Great Epics\\nSee also: Three Crowned Kings, Tamilakam, and List of Tamil monarchs\\nTamilakam, located at the tip of South India during the Sangam period, ruled by Chera dynasty, Chola dynasty and the Pandyan dynasty.Ilango Adigal, author of Silappatikaram, one of the five great epics of Tamil literature.[117]\\nDuring the Sangam period Tamil literature flourished from the 3rd century BCE to the 4th century CE. Three Tamil dynasties, collectively known as the Three Crowned Kings of Tamilakam: Chera dynasty, Chola dynasty, and the Pandya dynasty ruled parts of southern India.[118]\\nThe Sangam literature deals with the history, politics, wars, and culture of the Tamil people of this period.[119] Unlike Sanskrit writers who were mostly Brahmins, Sangam writers came from diverse classes and social backgrounds and were mostly non-Brahmins.[120]\\nAround c.\\u2009300 BCE – c.\\u2009200 CE, Pathupattu, an anthology of ten mid-length book collections, which is considered part of Sangam Literature, were composed; the composition of eight anthologies of poetic works Ettuthogai as well as the composition of eighteen minor poetic works Patiṉeṇkīḻkaṇakku; while Tolkāppiyam, the earliest grammarian work in the Tamil language was developed.[121] Also, during Sangam period, two of the Five Great Epics of Tamil Literature were composed. Ilango Adigal composed Silappatikaram, which is a non-religious work, that revolves around Kannagi,[122] and Manimekalai, composed by Chithalai Chathanar, is a sequel to Silappatikaram, and tells the story of the daughter of Kovalan and Madhavi, who became a Buddhist Bhikkhuni.[123][124]\\n\\nClassical period (c. 200 BCE – 650 CE)\\nMain article: Classical India\\n\\n\\n\\nAncient India during the rise of the Shunga Empire from the North, Satavahana dynasty from the Deccan, and Pandyan dynasty and Chola dynasty from the southern part of India.\\n\\n\\n\\nGreat Chaitya in the Karla Caves.

Also, the Sangam literature flourished from the 3rd century BCE to the 3rd century CE in southern India.[128] During this period, India\\'s economy is estimated to have been the largest in the world, having between one-third and one-quarter of the world\\'s wealth, from 1 CE to 1000 CE.[129][130]\\n\\nEarly classical period (c. 200 BCE – 320 CE)\\nShunga Empire\\nMain article: Shunga Empire\\nShunga EmpireEast Gateway and Railings, Bharhut Stupa, 2nd century BCE.Shunga art Ancient vina, 1st century BCE.Royal family, 1st century BCE in West Bengal.\\nThe Shungas originated from Magadha, and controlled large areas of the central and eastern Indian subcontinent from around 187 to 78\\xa0BCE. The dynasty was established by Pushyamitra Shunga, who overthrew the last Maurya emperor. Its capital was Pataliputra, but later emperors, such as Bhagabhadra, also held court at Vidisha, modern Besnagar.[131]\\nPushyamitra Shunga ruled for 36 years and was succeeded by his son Agnimitra. There were ten Shunga rulers. However, after the death of Agnimitra, the empire rapidly disintegrated;[132] inscriptions and coins indicate that much of northern and central India consisted of small kingdoms and city-states that were independent of any Shunga hegemony.[133] The empire is noted for its numerous wars with both foreign and indigenous powers. They fought with the Mahameghavahana dynasty of Kalinga, Satavahana dynasty of Deccan, the Indo-Greeks, and possibly the Panchalas and Mitras of Mathura.\\nArt, education, philosophy, and other forms of learning flowered during this period including architectural monuments such as the Stupa at Bharhut and the renowned Great Stupa at Sanchi. The Shunga rulers helped to establish the tradition of royal sponsorship of learning and art. The script used by the empire was a variant of Brahmi and was used to write the Sanskrit language. The Shunga Empire played an imperative role in patronising Indian culture at a time when some of the most important developments in Hindu thought were taking place.\\n\\nSatavahana Empire\\nMain article: Satavahana Empire\\nSatavahana EmpireSanchi Stupa Two and Southern Gateway, 1st century CE (UNESCO World Heritage Site).Indian ship on lead coin of Vasisthiputra Sri Pulamavi, testimony to the naval, seafaring and trading capabilities of the Sātavāhanas during the 1st–2nd century CE.\\nThe Śātavāhanas were based from Amaravati in Andhra Pradesh as well as Junnar (Pune) and Prathisthan (Paithan) in Maharashtra. The territory of the empire covered large parts of India from the 1st century BCE onward. The Sātavāhanas started out as feudatories to the Mauryan dynasty, but declared independence with its decline.\\nThe Sātavāhanas are known for their patronage of Hinduism and Buddhism, which resulted in Buddhist monuments from Ellora (a UNESCO World Heritage Site) to Amaravati. They were one of the first Indian states to issue coins with their rulers embossed. They formed a cultural bridge and played a vital role in trade as well as the transfer of ideas and culture to and from the Indo-Gangetic Plain to the southern tip of India.\\nThey had to compete with the Shunga Empire and then the Kanva dynasty of Magadha to establish their rule. Later, they played a crucial role to protect large part of India against foreign invaders like the Sakas, Yavanas and Pahlavas. In particular, their struggles with the Western Kshatrapas went on for a long time. The notable rulers of the Satavahana Dynasty Gautamiputra Satakarni and Sri Yajna Sātakarni were able to defeat the foreign invaders like the Western Kshatrapas and to stop their expansion. In the 3rd century CE, the empire was split into smaller states.[134]\\n\\nTrade and travels to India\\nFurther information: Silk Road transmission of Buddhism\\nSilk Road and Spice trade, ancient trade routes that linked India with the Old World; carried goods and ideas between the ancient civilisations of the Old World and India.

India\\'s Southwest coastal port Muziris had established itself as a major spice trade centre from as early as 3,000\\xa0BCE, according to Sumerian records. Jewish traders arrived in Kochi, Kerala, India as early as 562 BCE.[135] The Greco-Roman world followed by trading along the incense route and the Roman-India routes.[136] During the 2nd century BCE Greek and Indian ships met to trade at Arabian ports such as Aden.[137] During the first millennium, the sea routes to India were controlled by the Indians and Ethiopians that became the maritime trading power of the Red Sea.\\nIndian merchants involved in spice trade took Indian cuisine to Southeast Asia, where spice mixtures and curries became popular with the native inhabitants.[138] Buddhism entered China through the Silk Road in the 1st or 2nd century CE.[139] Hindu and Buddhist religious establishments of South and Southeast Asia came to be centres of production and commerce as they accumulated capital donated by patrons. They engaged in estate management, craftsmanship, and trade. Buddhism in particular travelled alongside the maritime trade, promoting literacy, art, and the use of coinage.[140]\\n\\nKushan Empire\\nMain article: Kushan Empire\\nKushan EmpireKushan territories (full line) and maximum extent of Kushan dominions under Kanishka (dotted line), according to the Rabatak inscriptionDepiction of the Buddha in Kanishka\\'s coinage, Mathura art, 2nd century CE\\nThe Kushan Empire expanded out of what is now Afghanistan into the northwest of the Indian subcontinent under the leadership of their first emperor, Kujula Kadphises, about the middle of the 1st century CE. The Kushans were possibly a Tocharian speaking tribe,[141] one of five branches of the Yuezhi confederation.[142][143] By the time of his grandson, Kanishka the Great, the empire spread to encompass much of Afghanistan,[144] and then the northern parts of the Indian subcontinent.[145]\\nEmperor Kanishka was a great patron of Buddhism; however, as Kushans expanded southward, the deities of their later coinage came to reflect its new Hindu majority.[146][147] Historian Vincent Smith said about Kanishka:\\n\\nHe played the part of a second Ashoka in the history of Buddhism.[148]\\nThe empire linked the Indian Ocean maritime trade with the commerce of the Silk Road through the Indus valley, encouraging long-distance trade, particularly between China and Rome. The Kushans brought new trends to the budding and blossoming Gandhara art and Mathura art, which reached its peak during Kushan rule.[149] The period of peace under Kushan rule is known as Pax Kushana.

The Gupta period marked a watershed of Indian culture: the Guptas performed Vedic sacrifices to legitimise their rule, but they also patronised Buddhism, an alternative to Brahmanical orthodoxy. The military exploits of the first three rulers – Chandragupta I, Samudragupta, and Chandragupta II – brought much of India under their leadership.[153] Science and political administration reached new heights during the Gupta era. Strong trade ties also made the region an important cultural centre and established it as a base that would influence nearby kingdoms and regions.[154][155] The period of peace under Gupta rule is known as Pax Gupta.\\nThe latter Guptas successfully resisted the northwestern kingdoms until the arrival of the Alchon Huns, who established themselves in Afghanistan by the first half of the 5th century CE, with their capital at Bamiyan.[156] However, much of the southern India including Deccan were largely unaffected by these events.[157][158]\\n\\nVakataka Empire\\nMain article: Vakataka Empire\\nThe Vākāṭaka Empire originated from the Deccan in the mid-third century CE.

All three dynasties claimed their descent from Narakasura.[citation needed] In the reign of the Varman king, Bhaskar Varman (c. 600–650\\xa0CE), the Chinese traveller Xuanzang visited the region and recorded his travels. Later, after weakening and disintegration (after the Kamarupa-Palas), the Kamarupa tradition was somewhat extended until c. 1255\\xa0CE by the Lunar I (c. 1120–1185\\xa0CE) and Lunar II (c. 1155–1255\\xa0CE) dynasties.[164] The Kamarupa kingdom came to an end in the middle of the 13th century when the Khen dynasty under Sandhya of Kamarupanagara (North Guwahati), moved his capital to Kamatapur (North Bengal) after the invasion of Muslim Turks, and established the Kamata kingdom.[165]\\n\\nPallava Empire\\nMain article: Pallava EmpireShore Temple (UNESCO World Heritage Site) at Mahabalipuram built by Narasimhavarman II.The Pallavas, during the 4th to 9th centuries were, alongside the Guptas of the North, great patronisers of Sanskrit development in the South of the Indian subcontinent. The Pallava reign saw the first Sanskrit inscriptions in a script called Grantha.[166] Early Pallavas had different connexions to Southeast Asian countries. The Pallavas used Dravidian architecture to build some very important Hindu temples and academies in Mamallapuram, Kanchipuram and other places; their rule saw the rise of great poets. The practice of dedicating temples to different deities came into vogue followed by fine artistic temple architecture and sculpture style of Vastu Shastra.[167]\\nPallavas reached the height of power during the reign of Mahendravarman I (571–630 CE) and Narasimhavarman I (630–668 CE) and dominated the Telugu and northern parts of the Tamil region until the end of the 9th century.[168]\\n\\nKadamba Empire\\nMain article: Kadamba Empire\\nKadamba shikara (tower) with Kalasa (pinnacle) on top, Doddagaddavalli.\\nKadambas originated from Karnataka, was founded by Mayurasharma in 345\\xa0CE which at later times showed the potential of developing into imperial proportions.

The Kadamba fame reached its peak during the rule of Kakusthavarma, a notable ruler with whom the kings of Gupta Dynasty of northern India cultivated marital alliances. The Kadambas were contemporaries of the Western Ganga Dynasty and together they formed the earliest native kingdoms to rule the land with absolute autonomy. The dynasty later continued to rule as a feudatory of larger Kannada empires, the Chalukya and the Rashtrakuta empires, for over five hundred years during which time they branched into minor dynasties (Kadambas of Goa, Kadambas of Halasi and Kadambas of Hangal).\\n\\nEmpire of Harsha\\nMain articles: Harsha and Pushyabhuti dynasty\\nHarsha ruled northern India from 606 to 647 CE. He was the son of Prabhakarvardhana and the younger brother of Rajyavardhana, who were members of the Vardhana dynasty and ruled Thanesar, in present-day Haryana.\\n\\nCoin of Emperor Harsha, c. 606–647 CE.[169]\\nAfter the downfall of the prior Gupta Empire in the middle of the 6th century, North India reverted to smaller republics and monarchical states. The power vacuum resulted in the rise of the Vardhanas of Thanesar, who began uniting the republics and monarchies from the Punjab to central India. After the death of Harsha\\'s father and brother, representatives of the empire crowned Harsha emperor in April 606 CE, giving him the title of Maharaja.[170] At the peak, his Empire covered much of North and Northwestern India, extended East until Kamarupa, and South until Narmada River; and eventually made Kannauj (in present Uttar Pradesh) his capital, and ruled until 647 CE.[171]\\nThe peace and prosperity that prevailed made his court a centre of cosmopolitanism, attracting scholars, artists and religious visitors.[171] During this time, Harsha converted to Buddhism from Surya worship.[172] The Chinese traveller Xuanzang visited the court of Harsha and wrote a very favourable account of him, praising his justice and generosity.[171] His biography Harshacharita (\"Deeds of Harsha\") written by Sanskrit poet Banabhatta, describes his association with Thanesar and the palace with a two-storied Dhavalagriha (White Mansion).[173][174]\\n\\nEarly medieval period (c. 650 – 1200)\\nMain articles: Medieval India, Decline of Buddhism in the Indian subcontinent, and Tripartite Struggle\\nEarly medieval India began after the end of the Gupta Empire in the 6th century\\xa0CE.[127] This period also covers the \"Late Classical Age\" of Hinduism, which began after the collapse of the Empire of Harsha in the 7th century,[175] and ended in the 13th century with the rise of the Delhi Sultanate in Northern India;[176] the beginning of Imperial Kannauj, leading to the Tripartite struggle; and the end of the Later Cholas with the death of Rajendra Chola III in 1279 in Southern India; however some aspects of the Classical period continued until the fall of the Vijayanagara Empire in the south around the 17th century.\\nFrom the fifth century to the thirteenth, Śrauta sacrifices declined, and support for Shaivism, Vaishnavism and Shaktism expanded in royal courts, while the support for Buddhism declined.[177] Lack of appeal among the rural masses, who instead embraced Brahmanical Hinduism formed in the Hindu synthesis, and dwindling financial support from trading communities and royal elites, were major factors in the decline of Buddhism.[178]\\nIn the 7th century, Kumārila Bhaṭṭa formulated his school of Mimamsa philosophy and defended the position on Vedic rituals.[179]\\nFrom the 8th to the 10th century, three dynasties contested for control of northern India: the Gurjara Pratiharas of Malwa, the Palas of Bengal, and the Rashtrakutas of the Deccan. The Sena dynasty would later assume control of the Pala Empire; the Gurjara Pratiharas fragmented into various states, notably the Kingdom of Malwa, the Kingdom of Bundelkhand, the Kingdom of Dahala, the Tomaras of Haryana, and the Kingdom of Sambhar, these states were some of the earliest Rajput kingdoms;[180] while the Rashtrakutas were annexed by the Western Chalukyas.[181] During this period, the Chaulukya dynasty emerged; the Chaulukyas constructed the Dilwara Temples, Modhera Sun Temple, Rani ki vav[182] in the style of Māru-Gurjara architecture, and their capital Anhilwara (modern Patan, Gujarat) was one of the largest cities in the Indian subcontinent, with the population estimated at 100,000 in c. 1000.\\nThe Chola Empire emerged as a major power during the reign of Raja Raja Chola I and Rajendra Chola I who successfully invaded parts of Southeast Asia and Sri Lanka in the 11th century.[183] Lalitaditya Muktapida (r. 724–760) was an emperor of the Kashmiri Karkoṭa dynasty, which exercised influence in northwestern India from 625 until 1003, and was followed by Lohara dynasty. Kalhana in his Rajatarangini credits king Lalitaditya with leading an aggressive military campaign in Northern India and Central Asia.[184][185][186]\\nThe Hindu Shahi dynasty ruled portions of eastern Afghanistan, northern Pakistan, and Kashmir from the mid-7th century to the early 11th century. While in Odisha, the Eastern Ganga Empire rose to power; noted for the advancement of Hindu architecture, most notable being Jagannath Temple and Konark Sun Temple, as well as being patrons of art and literature.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMartand Sun Temple Central shrine, dedicated to the deity Surya, and built by the third ruler of the Karkota dynasty, Lalitaditya Muktapida, in the 8th century\\n\\n\\n\\nKonark Sun Temple at Konark, Orissa, built by Narasimhadeva I (1238–1264) of the Eastern Ganga dynasty\\n\\n\\n\\nKandariya Mahadeva Temple in the Khajuraho complex was built by the Chandelas\\n\\n\\n\\nJagannath Temple at Puri, built by Anantavarman Chodaganga Deva of the Eastern Ganga dynasty\\n\\n\\nLater Gupta dynasty\\nMain article: Later Gupta dynasty\\nMap of the Later Guptas\\nThe Later Gupta dynasty ruled the Magadha region in eastern India between the 6th and 7th centuries AD. The Later Guptas succeeded the imperial Guptas as the rulers of Magadha, but there is no evidence connecting the two dynasties; these appear to be two distinct families.[187] The Later Guptas are so-called because the names of their rulers ended with the suffix \"-gupta\", which they might have adopted to portray themselves as the legitimate successors of the imperial Guptas.[188]\\n\\nChalukya Empire\\nMain article: Chalukya dynasty\\nThe Chalukya Empire ruled large parts of southern and central India between the 6th and the 12th centuries, as three related yet individual dynasties. The earliest dynasty, known as the \"Badami Chalukyas\", ruled from Vatapi (modern Badami) from the middle of the 6th century. The Badami Chalukyas began to assert their independence at the decline of the Kadamba kingdom of Banavasi and rapidly rose to prominence during the reign of Pulakeshin\\xa0II. The rule of the Chalukyas marks an important milestone in the history of South India and a golden age in the history of Karnataka. The political atmosphere in South India shifted from smaller kingdoms to large empires with the ascendancy of Badami Chalukyas. A Southern India-based kingdom took control and consolidated the entire region between the Kaveri and the Narmada Rivers. The rise of this empire saw the birth of efficient administration, overseas trade and commerce and the development of new style of architecture called \"Chalukyan architecture\". The Chalukya dynasty ruled parts of southern and central India from Badami in Karnataka between 550 and 750, and then again from Kalyani between 970 and 1190.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGalaganatha Temple at Pattadakal complex (UNESCO World Heritage) is an example of Badami Chalukya architecture\\n\\n\\n\\nBhutanatha temple complex at Badami, next to a waterfall, during the monsoon.\\n\\n\\n\\nVishnu image inside the Badami Cave Temple Complex.

Amoghavarsha was also an author and wrote Kavirajamarga, the earliest known Kannada work on poetics.[190][194] Architecture reached a milestone in the Dravidian style, the finest example of which is seen in the Kailasanath Temple at Ellora. Other important contributions are the Kashivishvanatha temple and the Jain Narayana temple at Pattadakal in Karnataka.\\nThe Arab traveller Suleiman described the Rashtrakuta Empire as one of the four great Empires of the world.[195] The Rashtrakuta period marked the beginning of the golden age of southern Indian mathematics. The great south Indian mathematician Mahāvīra had a huge impact on medieval south Indian mathematicians.[196] The Rashtrakuta rulers also patronised men of letters in a variety of languages.[190]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nKailasa temple, is one of the largest rock-cut ancient Hindu temples located in Ellora\\n\\n\\n\\nShikhara of Indra Sabha at Ellora Caves\\n\\n\\n\\nStatue of the Buddha seated.

Nagabhata I defeated the Arab army under Junaid and Tamin during the Umayyad campaigns in India.[197] Under Nagabhata II, the Gurjara-Pratiharas became the most powerful dynasty in northern India. He was succeeded by his son Ramabhadra, who ruled briefly before being succeeded by his son, Mihira Bhoja. Under Bhoja and his successor Mahendrapala I, the Pratihara Empire reached its peak of prosperity and power. By the time of Mahendrapala, its territory stretched from the border of Sindh in the west to Bihar in the east and from the Himalayas in the north to around the Narmada River in the south.[198] The expansion triggered a tripartite power struggle with the Rashtrakuta and Pala empires for control of the Indian subcontinent.\\nBy the end of the 10th century, several feudatories of the empire took advantage of the temporary weakness of the Gurjara-Pratiharas to declare their independence, notably the Kingdom of Malwa, the Kingdom of Bundelkhand, the Tomaras of Haryana, and the Kingdom of Sambhar[199] and the Kingdom of Dahala.[citation needed]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOne of the four entrances of the Teli ka Mandir, built by the Pratihara emperor Mihira Bhoja.[200]\\n\\n\\n\\nSculptures near Teli ka Mandir, Gwalior Fort\\n\\n\\n\\nJainism-related cave monuments and statues carved into the rock face inside Siddhachal Caves, Gwalior Fort\\n\\n\\n\\nGhateshwara Mahadeva temple at Baroli Temples complex.

The dynasty was established by Nanyadeva, a military commander of Karnataka origin. Under this dynasty, the Maithili language started to develop with the first piece of Maithili literature, the Varna Ratnakara being produced in the 14th century by Jyotirishwar Thakur. The Karnats also carried out raids into Nepal. They fell in 1324 following the invasion of Ghiyasuddin Tughlaq.[202][203]\\n\\nPala Empire\\nExcavated ruins of Nalanda, a centre of Buddhist learning from 450 to 1193\\nMain article: Pala Empire\\nThe Pala Empire was founded by Gopala I.[204][205][206] It was ruled by a Buddhist dynasty from Bengal. The Palas reunified Bengal after the fall of Shashanka\\'s Gauda Kingdom.[207]\\nThe Palas were followers of the Mahayana and Tantric schools of Buddhism,[208] they also patronised Shaivism and Vaishnavism.[209] The empire reached its peak under Dharmapala and Devapala. Dharmapala is believed to have conquered Kanauj and extended his sway up to the farthest limits of India in the north-west.[209]\\nThe Pala Empire can be considered as the golden era of Bengal.[210] Dharmapala founded the Vikramashila and revived Nalanda,[209] considered one of the first great universities in recorded history. Nalanda reached its height under the patronage of the Pala Empire.[210][211] The Palas also built many viharas. They maintained close cultural and commercial ties with countries of Southeast Asia and Tibet. Sea trade added greatly to the prosperity of the Pala Empire.\\n\\nCholas\\nMain articles: Chola dynasty and Chola Empire\\nChola Empire under Rajendra Chola, c. 1030\\nMedieval Cholas rose to prominence during the middle of the 9th century and established the greatest empire South India had seen.[212] They successfully united the South India under their rule and through their naval strength extended their influence in the Southeast Asian countries such as Srivijaya.[183] Under Rajaraja Chola I and his successors Rajendra Chola I, Rajadhiraja Chola, Virarajendra Chola and Kulothunga Chola I the dynasty became a military, economic and cultural power in South Asia and South-East Asia.[213][214] Rajendra Chola I\\'s navies occupied the sea coasts from Burma to Vietnam,[215] the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, the Lakshadweep (Laccadive) islands, Sumatra, and the Malay Peninsula. The power of the new empire was proclaimed to the eastern world by the expedition to the Ganges which Rajendra Chola I undertook and by the occupation of cities of the maritime empire of Srivijaya in Southeast Asia, as well as by the repeated embassies to China.[216]\\nThey dominated the political affairs of Sri Lanka for over two centuries through repeated invasions and occupation. They also had continuing trade contacts with the Arabs and the Chinese empire.[217] Rajaraja Chola I and his son Rajendra Chola I gave political unity to the whole of Southern India and established the Chola Empire as a respected sea power.[218] Under the Cholas, the South India reached new heights of excellence in art, religion and literature. In all of these spheres, the Chola period marked the culmination of movements that had begun in an earlier age under the Pallavas. Monumental architecture in the form of majestic temples and sculpture in stone and bronze reached a finesse never before achieved in India.[219]\\n\\nSrirangam Ranganathaswamy Temple is the world\\'s largest functioning Hindu temple[220] present in Tamil Nadu, India \\n\\n\\n\\nThe granite gopuram (tower) of Brihadeeswarar Temple, 1010\\n\\n\\n\\nChariot detail at Airavatesvara Temple built by Rajaraja Chola II in the 12th century\\n\\n\\n\\nThe pyramidal structure above the sanctum at Brihadisvara Temple.\\n\\n\\n\\nBrihadeeswara Temple Entrance Gopurams at Thanjavur\\n\\n\\nWestern Chalukya Empire\\nMain article: Western Chalukya Empire\\nThe Western Chalukya Empire ruled most of the western Deccan, South India, between the 10th and 12th centuries.[221] Vast areas between the Narmada River in the north and Kaveri River in the south came under Chalukya control.[221] During this period the other major ruling families of the Deccan, the Hoysalas, the Seuna Yadavas of Devagiri, the Kakatiya dynasty and the Southern Kalachuris, were subordinates of the Western Chalukyas and gained their independence only when the power of the Chalukya waned during the latter half of the 12th century.[222]\\nThe Western Chalukyas developed an architectural style known today as a transitional style, an architectural link between the style of the early Chalukya dynasty and that of the later Hoysala empire. Most of its monuments are in the districts bordering the Tungabhadra River in central Karnataka. Well known examples are the Kasivisvesvara Temple at Lakkundi, the Mallikarjuna Temple at Kuruvatti, the Kallesvara Temple at Bagali, Siddhesvara Temple at Haveri, and the Mahadeva Temple at Itagi.[223] This was an important period in the development of fine arts in Southern India, especially in literature as the Western Chalukya kings encouraged writers in the native language of Kannada, and Sanskrit like the philosopher and statesman Basava and the great mathematician Bhāskara II.[224][225]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nShrine outer wall and Dravida style superstructure (shikhara) at Siddhesvara Temple at Haveri\\n\\n\\n\\nOrnate entrance to the closed hall from the south at Kalleshvara Temple at Bagali\\n\\n\\n\\nShrine wall relief, molding frieze and miniature decorative tower in Mallikarjuna Temple at Kuruvatti\\n\\n\\n\\nRear view showing lateral entrances of the Mahadeva Temple at Itagi\\n\\n\\nLate medieval period (c. 1200 – 1526)\\nMain article: Medieval India\\nSee also: Muslim kingdoms in the Indian subcontinent\\nThe late medieval period is marked by repeated invasions by Muslim Central Asian nomadic clans,[226][227] the rule of the Delhi Sultanate, and by the growth of other states, built upon military technology of the sultanate.[228]\\n\\nDelhi Sultanate\\nMain article: Delhi Sultanate\\nThe Delhi Sultanate was a series of successive Islamic states based in Delhi, ruled by several dynasties of varying origins. The polity ruled over large parts of the Indian subcontinent from the 13th to early 16th centuries.[229] The sultanate was founded in the 12th and 13th centuries by Central Asian Turks, who invaded parts of northern India and established the state atop former Hindu holdings.[230] The subsequent Mamluk dynasty of Delhi managed to conquer large areas of northern India. The Khalji dynasty conquered much of central India while forcing the principal Hindu kingdoms of South India to become vassal states.[229]\\nThe sultanate ushered in a period of Indian cultural renaissance. The resulting \"Indo-Muslim\" fusion of cultures left lasting syncretic monuments in architecture, music, literature, religion, and clothing. It is surmised that the language of Urdu was born during the period of the Delhi Sultanate. The sultanate was the only Indo-Islamic state to enthrone one of the few female rulers in India, Razia Sultana (r.\\u20091236–1240).\\nWhile initially disruptive due to the passing of power from native Indian elites to Turkic Muslim elites, the Delhi Sultanate was responsible for integrating the Indian subcontinent into a growing world system, drawing India into a wider international network, which had a significant impact on Indian culture and society.[231] However, the Delhi Sultanate also caused large-scale destruction and desecration of temples in the Indian subcontinent.[232]\\nThe Mongol invasions of India were successfully repelled by the Delhi Sultanate during the rule of Alauddin Khalji. A major factor in their success was their Turkic Mamluk slave army, who were highly skilled in the same style of nomadic cavalry warfare as the Mongols. It is possible that the Mongol Empire may have expanded into India were it not for the Delhi Sultanate\\'s role in repelling them.[233] By repeatedly repulsing the Mongol raiders,[234] the sultanate saved India from the devastation waged on West and Central Asia. Soldiers from that region and learned men and administrators fleeing Mongol invasions of Iran migrated into the subcontinent, thereby creating a syncretic Indo-Islamic culture in the north.[233]\\nA Turco-Mongol conqueror from Central Asia, Timur (Tamerlane), attacked the reigning sultan Nasir-u Din Mehmud of the Tughlaq dynasty in Delhi.[235] The sultan\\'s army was defeated on 17 December 1398. Timur entered Delhi and the city was sacked, destroyed, and left in ruins after Timur\\'s army had killed and plundered for three days and nights. He ordered the whole city to be sacked except for the sayyids, scholars, and the \"other Muslims\" (artists); 100,000 war prisoners were said to have been put to death in one day.[236] The sultanate suffered significantly from the sacking of Delhi. Though revived briefly under the Sayyid and Lodi dynasties, it was but a shadow of the former. Lodi rule lasted in Delhi until the defeat of the last sultan, Ibrahim Khan Lodi, in 1526 to the forces of Babur.[237]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nQutb Minar, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, whose construction was begun by Qutb ud-Din Aibak, the first Sultan of Delhi.\\n\\n\\n\\nDargahs of Sufi-saint Nizamuddin Auliya, and poet and musician Amir Khusro in Delhi.\\n\\n\\nVijayanagara Empire\\nMain article: Vijayanagara Empire\\nMap of the Sangama dynasty of the Vijayanagara Empire \\nThe Vijayanagara Empire was established in 1336 by Harihara I and his brother Bukka Raya I of Sangama Dynasty,[238] which originated as a political heir of the Hoysala Empire, Kakatiya Empire,[239] and the Pandyan Empire.[240] The empire rose to prominence as a culmination of attempts by the south Indian powers to ward off Islamic invasions by the end of the 13th century. It lasted until 1646, although its power declined after a major military defeat in 1565 by the combined armies of the Deccan sultanates. The empire is named after its capital city of Vijayanagara, whose ruins surround present day Hampi, now a World Heritage Site in Karnataka, India.[241]\\nIn the first two decades after the founding of the empire, Harihara I gained control over most of the area south of the Tungabhadra river and earned the title of Purvapaschima Samudradhishavara (\"master of the eastern and western seas\"). By 1374 Bukka Raya I, successor to Harihara I, had defeated the chiefdom of Arcot, the Reddys of Kondavidu, and the Sultan of Madurai and had gained control over Goa in the west and the Tungabhadra-Krishna doab in the north.[242][243]\\nHarihara II, the second son of Bukka Raya I, further consolidated the kingdom beyond the Krishna River and brought the whole of South India under the Vijayanagara umbrella.[244] The next ruler, Deva Raya I, emerged successful against the Gajapatis of Odisha and undertook important works of fortification and irrigation.[245] Italian traveller Niccolo de Conti wrote of him as the most powerful ruler of India.[246] Deva Raya II succeeded to the throne in 1424 and was possibly the most capable of the Sangama Dynasty rulers.[247] He quelled rebelling feudal lords as well as the Zamorin of Calicut and Quilon in the south. He invaded the island of Sri Lanka and became overlord of the kings of Burma at Pegu and Tanasserim.[248][249][250]\\nThe Vijayanagara Emperors were tolerant of all religions and sects, as writings by foreign visitors show.[251] The kings used titles such as Gobrahamana Pratipalanacharya (literally, \"protector of cows and Brahmins\") and Hindurayasuratrana (lit, \"upholder of Hindu faith\") that testified to their intention of protecting Hinduism and yet were at the same time staunchly Islamicate in their court ceremonials and dress.[252] The empire\\'s founders, Harihara I and Bukka Raya I, were devout Shaivas (worshippers of Shiva), but made grants to the Vaishnava order of Sringeri with Vidyaranya as their patron saint, and designated Varaha (an avatar of Vishnu) as their emblem.[253] Nobles from Central Asia\\'s Timurid kingdoms also came to Vijayanagara.[254] The later Saluva and Tuluva kings were Vaishnava by faith, but worshipped at the feet of Lord Virupaksha (Shiva) at Hampi as well as Lord Venkateshwara (Vishnu) at Tirupati.[255] A Sanskrit work, Jambavati Kalyanam by King Krishnadevaraya, called Lord Virupaksha Karnata Rajya Raksha Mani (\"protective jewel of Karnata Empire\").[256] The kings patronised the saints of the dvaita order (philosophy of dualism) of Madhvacharya at Udupi.[257]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPhotograph of the ruins of the Vijayanagara Empire at Hampi, now a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1868[258]\\n\\n\\n\\nGajashaala, or elephant\\'s stable, was built by the Vijayanagar rulers for their war elephants.[259]\\n\\n\\n\\nVijayanagara marketplace at Hampi, along with the sacred tank located on the side of Krishna temple.\\n\\n\\n\\nStone temple car in Vitthala Temple at Hampi\\n\\n\\nThe empire\\'s legacy includes many monuments spread over South India, the best known of which is the group at Hampi. The previous temple building traditions in South India came together in the Vijayanagara Architecture style. The mingling of all faiths and vernaculars inspired architectural innovation of Hindu temple construction. South Indian mathematics flourished under the protection of the Vijayanagara Empire in Kerala. The south Indian mathematician Madhava of Sangamagrama founded the famous Kerala School of Astronomy and Mathematics in the 14th century which produced a lot of great south Indian mathematicians like Parameshvara, Nilakantha Somayaji and Jyeṣṭhadeva.[260] Efficient administration and vigorous overseas trade brought new technologies such as water management systems for irrigation.[261] The empire\\'s patronage enabled fine arts and literature to reach new heights in Kannada, Telugu, Tamil, and Sanskrit, while Carnatic music evolved into its current form.[262]\\nVijayanagara went into decline after the defeat in the Battle of Talikota (1565). After the death of Aliya Rama Raya in the Battle of Talikota, Tirumala Deva Raya started the Aravidu dynasty, moved and founded a new capital of Penukonda to replace the destroyed Hampi, and attempted to reconstitute the remains of Vijayanagara Empire.[263] Tirumala abdicated in 1572, dividing the remains of his kingdom to his three sons, and pursued a religious life until his death in 1578. The Aravidu dynasty successors ruled the region but the empire collapsed in 1614, and the final remains ended in 1646, from continued wars with the Bijapur sultanate and others.[264][265][266] During this period, more kingdoms in South India became independent and separate from Vijayanagara. These include the Mysore Kingdom, Keladi Nayaka, Nayaks of Madurai, Nayaks of Tanjore, Nayakas of Chitradurga and Nayak Kingdom of Gingee\\xa0– all of which declared independence and went on to have a significant impact on the history of South India in the coming centuries.[264]\\n\\nOther kingdoms\\nMain articles: Guhila dynasty and Kingdom of Mewar\\n\\n\\n\\nVijaya Stambha (Tower of Victory).\\n\\n\\n\\nTemple inside Chittorgarh fort\\n\\n\\n\\nMan Singh (Manasimha) palace at the Gwalior fort\\n\\n\\n\\nChinese manuscript Tribute Giraffe with Attendant, depicting a giraffe presented by Bengali envoys in the name of Sultan Saifuddin Hamza Shah of Bengal to the Yongle Emperor of Ming China\\n\\n\\n\\nMahmud Gawan Madrasa was built by Mahmud Gawan, the Wazir of the Bahmani Sultanate as the centre of religious as well as secular education\\n\\n\\nFor two and a half centuries from the mid-13th century, politics in Northern India was dominated by the Delhi Sultanate, and in Southern India by the Vijayanagar Empire. However, there were other regional powers present as well. After fall of Pala Empire, the Chero dynasty ruled much of Eastern Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Jharkhand from the 12th to the 18th centuries.[267][268][269] The Reddy dynasty successfully defeated the Delhi Sultanate and extended their rule from Cuttack in the north to Kanchi in the south, eventually being absorbed into the expanding Vijayanagara Empire.[270]\\nIn the north, the Rajput kingdoms remained the dominant force in Western and Central India. The Mewar dynasty under Maharana Hammir defeated and captured Muhammad Tughlaq with the Bargujars as his main allies. Tughlaq had to pay a huge ransom and relinquish all of Mewar\\'s lands. After this event, the Delhi Sultanate did not attack Chittor for a few hundred years. The Rajputs re-established their independence, and Rajput states were established as far east as Bengal and north into the Punjab. The Tomaras established themselves at Gwalior, and Man Singh Tomar reconstructed the Gwalior Fort.[271] During this period, Mewar emerged as the leading Rajput state; and Rana Kumbha expanded his kingdom at the expense of the Sultanates of Malwa and Gujarat.[271][272] The next great Rajput ruler, Rana Sanga of Mewar, became the principal player in Northern India. His objectives grew in scope – he planned to conquer Delhi. But, his defeat in the Battle of Khanwa consolidated the new Mughal dynasty in India.[271] The Mewar dynasty under Maharana Udai Singh II faced further defeat by Mughal emperor Akbar, with their capital Chittor being captured. Due to this event, Udai Singh II founded Udaipur, which became the new capital of the Mewar kingdom. His son, Maharana Pratap of Mewar, firmly resisted the Mughals. Akbar sent many missions against him. He survived to ultimately gain control of all of Mewar, excluding the Chittor Fort.[273]\\nIn the south, the Bahmani Sultanate in the Deccan, born from a rebellion in 1347 against the Tughlaq dynasty,[274] was the chief rival of Vijayanagara, and frequently created difficulties for them.[275] Starting in 1490, the Bahmani Sultanate\\'s governors revolted, their independent states composing the five Deccan sultanates; Ahmadnagar declared independence, followed by Bijapur and Berar in the same year; Golkonda became independent in 1518 and Bidar in 1528.[276] Although generally rivals, they allied against the Vijayanagara Empire in 1565, permanently weakening Vijayanagar in the Battle of Talikota.[277][278]\\nIn the East, the Gajapati Kingdom remained a strong regional power to reckon with, associated with a high point in the growth of regional culture and architecture. Under Kapilendradeva, Gajapatis became an empire stretching from the lower Ganga in the north to the Kaveri in the south.[279] In Northeast India, the Ahom Kingdom was a major power for six centuries;[280][281] led by Lachit Borphukan, the Ahoms decisively defeated the Mughal army at the Battle of Saraighat during the Ahom-Mughal conflicts.[282] Further east in Northeastern India was the Kingdom of Manipur, which ruled from their seat of power at Kangla Fort and developed a sophisticated Hindu Gaudiya Vaishnavite culture.[283][284][285]\\nThe Sultanate of Bengal was the dominant power of the Ganges–Brahmaputra Delta, with a network of mint towns spread across the region. It was a Sunni Muslim monarchy with Indo-Turkic, Arab, Abyssinian and Bengali Muslim elites. The sultanate was known for its religious pluralism where non-Muslim communities co-existed peacefully. The Bengal Sultanate had a circle of vassal states, including Odisha in the southwest, Arakan in the southeast, and Tripura in the east. In the early 16th century, the Bengal Sultanate reached the peak of its territorial growth with control over Kamrup and Kamata in the northeast and Jaunpur and Bihar in the west. It was reputed as a thriving trading nation and one of Asia\\'s strongest states. The Bengal Sultanate was described by contemporary European and Chinese visitors as a relatively prosperous kingdom and the \"richest country to trade with\". The Bengal Sultanate left a strong architectural legacy. Buildings from the period show foreign influences merged into a distinct Bengali style. The Bengal Sultanate was also the largest and most prestigious authority among the independent medieval Muslim-ruled states in the history of Bengal. Its decline began with an interregnum by the Suri Empire, followed by Mughal conquest and disintegration into petty kingdoms.\\n\\nBhakti movement and Sikhism\\nMain articles: Bhakti movement, Buddhism in India, and Sikhism\\nSee also: History of Sikhism\\nThe Bhakti movement refers to the theistic devotional trend that emerged in medieval Hinduism[286] and later revolutionised in Sikhism.[287] It originated in the seventh-century south India (now parts of Tamil Nadu and Kerala), and spread northwards.[286] It swept over east and north India from the 15th century onwards, reaching its zenith between the 15th and 17th century.[288]\\n\\nThe Bhakti movement regionally developed around different gods and goddesses, such as Vaishnavism (Vishnu), Shaivism (Shiva), Shaktism (Shakti goddesses), and Smartism.[289][290][291] The movement was inspired by many poet-saints, who championed a wide range of philosophical positions ranging from theistic dualism of Dvaita to absolute monism of Advaita Vedanta.[292][293]\\nSikhism is a monotheistic and panentheistic religion based on the spiritual teachings of Guru Nanak, the first Guru,[294] and the ten successive Sikh gurus. After the death of the tenth Guru, Guru Gobind Singh, the Sikh scripture, Guru Granth Sahib, became the literal embodiment of the eternal, impersonal Guru, where the scripture\\'s word serves as the spiritual guide for Sikhs.[295][296][297]\\nBuddhism in India flourished in the Himalayan kingdoms of Namgyal Kingdom in Ladakh, Sikkim Kingdom in Sikkim, and Chutia Kingdom in Arunachal Pradesh of the Late medieval period.\\n\\n\\n\\nRang Ghar, built by Pramatta Singha in Ahom kingdom\\'s capital Rangpur, is one of the earliest pavilions of outdoor stadia in the Indian subcontinent\\n\\n\\n\\nChittor Fort is the largest fort on the Indian subcontinent; it is one of the six Hill Forts of Rajasthan\\n\\n\\n\\nRanakpur Jain temple was built in the 15th century with the support of the Rajput state of Mewar\\n\\n\\n\\nGol Gumbaz built by the Bijapur Sultanate, has the second largest pre-modern dome in the world after the Byzantine Hagia Sophia\\n\\n\\nEarly modern period (1526–1858)\\nThe early modern period of Indian history is dated from 1526 to 1858, corresponding to the rise and fall of the Mughal Empire, which inherited from the Timurid Renaissance. During this age India\\'s economy expanded, relative peace was maintained and arts were patronised. This period witnessed the further development of Indo-Islamic architecture;[298][299] the growth of Marathas and Sikhs enabled them to rule significant regions of India in the waning days of the Mughal empire.[16] With the discovery of the Cape route in the 1500s, the first Europeans to arrive by sea and establish themselves, were the Portuguese in Goa and Bombay.[300]\\n\\nMughal Empire\\nMain article: Mughal Empire\\nSee also: Bengal Subah, Muslin trade in Bengal, Mughal architecture, Army of the Mughal Empire, Mughal clothing, and Mughal painting\\nMughal EmpireMap of the Mughal Empire at its peak in year 1700Taj Mahal is the jewel of Muslim architecture in India UNESCO World Heritage Site declaration, 1983.[301]\\nIn 1526, Babur swept across the Khyber Pass and established the Mughal Empire, which at its zenith covered much of South Asia.[302] However, his son Humayun was defeated by the Afghan warrior Sher Shah Suri in 1540, and Humayun was forced to retreat to Kabul. After Sher Shah\\'s death, his son Islam Shah Suri and his Hindu general Hemu Vikramaditya established secular rule in North India from Delhi until 1556, when Akbar (r.\\u20091556–1605), grandson of Babur, defeated Hemu in the Second Battle of Panipat on 6 November 1556 after winning Battle of Delhi. Akbar tried to establish a good relationship with the Hindus. Akbar declared \"Amari\" or non-killing of animals in the holy days of Jainism. He rolled back the jizya tax for non-Muslims. The Mughal emperors married local royalty, allied themselves with local maharajas, and attempted to fuse their Turko-Persian culture with ancient Indian styles, creating a unique Indo-Persian culture and Indo-Saracenic architecture.\\nAkbar married a Rajput princess, Mariam-uz-Zamani, and they had a son, Jahangir (r.\\u20091605–1627).[303] Jahangir followed his father\\'s policy. The Mughal dynasty ruled most of the Indian subcontinent by 1600. The reign of Shah Jahan (r.\\u20091628–1658) was the golden age of Mughal architecture. He erected several large monuments, the most famous of which is the Taj Mahal at Agra.\\nIt was one of the largest empires to have existed in the Indian subcontinent,[304] and surpassed China to become the world\\'s largest economic power, controlling 24.4% of the world economy,[305] and the world leader in manufacturing,[306] producing 25% of global industrial output.[307] The economic and demographic upsurge was stimulated by Mughal agrarian reforms that intensified agricultural production,[308] and a relatively high degree of urbanisation.[309]\\n\\nOther Mughal UNESCO World Heritage Sites\\n\\n\\nAgra Fort showing Yamuna river and Taj Mahal in the background\\n\\n\\n\\nFatehpur Sikri, near Agra, showing Buland Darwaza, the complex built by Akbar, the third Mughal emperor\\n\\n\\n\\nRed Fort, Delhi, constructed in the year 1648\\n\\n\\nThe Mughal Empire reached the zenith of its territorial expanse during the reign of Aurangzeb (r.\\u20091658–1707), under whose reign India surpassed Qing China as the world\\'s largest economy.[310][311] Aurangzeb was less tolerant than his predecessors, reintroducing the jizya tax and destroying several historical temples, while at the same time building more Hindu temples than he destroyed,[312] employing significantly more Hindus in his imperial bureaucracy than his predecessors, and advancing administrators based on ability rather than religion.[313] However, he is often blamed for the erosion of the tolerant syncretic tradition of his predecessors, as well as increasing religious controversy and centralisation. The English East India Company suffered a defeat in the Anglo-Mughal War.[314][315]\\n\\n18th-century political formation in India\\nThe Mughals suffered several blows due to invasions from Marathas, Rajputs, Jats and Afghans. In 1737, the Maratha general Bajirao of the Maratha Empire invaded and plundered Delhi. Under the general Amir Khan Umrao Al Udat, the Mughal Emperor sent 8,000 troops to drive away the 5,000 Maratha cavalry soldiers. Baji Rao easily routed the novice Mughal general. In 1737, in the final defeat of Mughal Empire, the commander-in-chief of the Mughal Army, Nizam-ul-mulk, was routed at Bhopal by the Maratha army. This essentially brought an end to the Mughal Empire.[citation needed] While Bharatpur State under Jat ruler Suraj Mal, overran the Mughal garrison at Agra and plundered the city.[316] In 1739, Nader Shah, emperor of Iran, defeated the Mughal army at the Battle of Karnal.[317] After this victory, Nader captured and sacked Delhi, carrying away treasures including the Peacock Throne.[318] Ahmad Shah Durrani commenced his own invasions as ruler of the Durrani Empire, eventually sacking Delhi in 1757.[319] Mughal rule was further weakened by constant native Indian resistance; Banda Singh Bahadur led the Sikh Khalsa against Mughal religious oppression; Hindu Rajas of Bengal, Pratapaditya and Raja Sitaram Ray revolted; and Maharaja Chhatrasal, of Bundela Rajputs, fought the Mughals and established the Panna State.[320] The Mughal dynasty was reduced to puppet rulers by 1757. Vadda Ghalughara took place under the Muslim provincial government based at Lahore to wipe out the Sikhs, with 30,000 Sikhs being killed, an offensive that had begun with the Mughals, with the Chhota Ghallughara,[321] and lasted several decades under its Muslim successor states.[322]\\n\\nMaratha Empire\\nMain article: Maratha Empire\\nFurther information: Maratha Army, Maratha Navy, and Battles involving the Maratha Empire\\nMaratha EmpireMaratha Empire at its peak in 1760 (yellow area), covering much of the Indian subcontinent, stretching from South India to present-day PakistanShaniwarwada palace fort in Pune, the seat of the Peshwa rulers of the Maratha Empire until 1818\\nThe Maratha kingdom was founded and consolidated by Chatrapati Shivaji.[323] However, the credit for making the Marathas formidable power nationally goes to Peshwa (chief minister) Bajirao I. Historian K.K. Datta wrote that Bajirao I \"may very well be regarded as the second founder of the Maratha Empire\".[324]\\nIn the early 18th century, under the Peshwas, the Marathas consolidated and ruled over much of South Asia. The Marathas are credited to a large extent for ending Mughal rule in India.[325][326][327] In 1737, the Marathas defeated a Mughal army in their capital, in the Battle of Delhi. The Marathas continued their military campaigns against the Mughals, Nizam, Nawab of Bengal and the Durrani Empire to further extend their boundaries. At its peak, the domain of the Marathas encompassed most of the Indian subcontinent.[328] The Marathas even attempted to capture Delhi and discussed putting Vishwasrao Peshwa on the throne there in place of the Mughal emperor.[329]\\nThe Maratha empire at its peak stretched from Tamil Nadu in the south,[330] to Peshawar (modern-day Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan[331] [note 2]) in the north, and Bengal in the east. The Northwestern expansion of the Marathas was stopped after the Third Battle of Panipat (1761). However, the Maratha authority in the north was re-established within a decade under Peshwa Madhavrao I.[333]\\nUnder Madhavrao I, the strongest knights were granted semi-autonomy, creating a confederacy of United Maratha states under the Gaekwads of Baroda, the Holkars of Indore and Malwa, the Scindias of Gwalior and Ujjain, the Bhonsales of Nagpur and the Puars of Dhar and Dewas. In 1775, the East India Company intervened in a Peshwa family succession struggle in Pune, which led to the First Anglo-Maratha War, resulting in a Maratha victory.[334] The Marathas remained a major power in India until their defeat in the Second and Third Anglo-Maratha Wars (1805–1818).\\n\\nSikh Empire\\nMain article: Sikh Empire\\nSee also: Sikh architecture\\nThe Sikh Empire was a political entity that governed the Northwestern regions of the Indian subcontinent, based around the Punjab, from 1799 to 1849. It was forged, on the foundations of the Khalsa, under the leadership of Maharaja Ranjit Singh (1780–1839).[citation needed]\\nMaharaja Ranjit Singh consolidated much of northern India into an empire using his Sikh Khalsa Army, trained in European military techniques and equipped with modern military technologies. Ranjit Singh proved himself to be a master strategist and selected well-qualified generals for his army. He successfully ended the Afghan-Sikh Wars. In stages, he added central Punjab, the provinces of Multan and Kashmir, and the Peshawar Valley to his empire.[335][336]\\nAt its peak in the 19th century, the empire extended from the Khyber Pass in the west, to Kashmir in the north, to Sindh in the south, running along Sutlej river to Himachal in the east. After the death of Ranjit Singh, the empire weakened, leading to conflict with the British East India Company. The First Anglo-Sikh War and Second Anglo-Sikh War marked the downfall of the Sikh Empire, making it among the last areas of the Indian subcontinent to be conquered by the British.\\n\\nOther kingdoms\\nTerritories of India in 1763\\nThe Kingdom of Mysore in southern India expanded to its greatest extent under Hyder Ali and his son Tipu Sultan in the later half of the 18th century. Under their rule, Mysore fought series of wars against the Marathas and British or their combined forces. The Maratha–Mysore War ended in April 1787, following the finalising of treaty of Gajendragad, in which Tipu Sultan was obligated to pay tribute to the Marathas. Concurrently, the Anglo-Mysore Wars took place, where the Mysoreans used the Mysorean rockets. The Fourth Anglo-Mysore War (1798–1799) saw the death of Tipu. Mysore\\'s alliance with the French was seen as a threat to the British East India Company, and Mysore was attacked from all four sides. The Nizam of Hyderabad and the Marathas launched an invasion from the north. The British won a decisive victory at the Siege of Seringapatam (1799).\\nHyderabad was founded by the Qutb Shahi dynasty of Golconda in 1591. Following a brief Mughal rule, Asif Jah, a Mughal official, seized control of Hyderabad and declared himself Nizam-al-Mulk of Hyderabad in 1724. The Nizams lost considerable territory and paid tribute to the Maratha Empire after being routed in multiple battles, such as the Battle of Palkhed.[337] However, the Nizams maintained their sovereignty from 1724 until 1948 through paying tributes to the Marathas, and later, being vassals of the British. Hyderabad State became a princely state in British India in 1798.\\nThe Nawabs of Bengal had become the de facto rulers of Bengal following the decline of Mughal Empire. However, their rule was interrupted by Marathas who carried out six expeditions in Bengal from 1741 to 1748, as a result of which Bengal became a tributary state of Marathas. On 23 June 1757, Siraj ud-Daulah, the last independent Nawab of Bengal was betrayed in the Battle of Plassey by Mir Jafar. He lost to the British, who took over the charge of Bengal in 1757, installed Mir Jafar on the Masnad (throne) and established itself to a political power in Bengal.[338] In 1765 the system of Dual Government was established, in which the Nawabs ruled on behalf of the British and were mere puppets to the British. In 1772 the system was abolished and Bengal was brought under the direct control of the British. In 1793, when the Nizamat (governorship) of the Nawab was also taken away, they remained as mere pensioners of the British East India Company.[339][340]\\nIn the 18th century, the whole of Rajputana was virtually subdued by the Marathas. The Second Anglo-Maratha War distracted the Marathas from 1807 to 1809, but afterward Maratha domination of Rajputana resumed. In 1817, the British went to war with the Pindaris, raiders who were fled in Maratha territory, which quickly became the Third Anglo-Maratha War, and the British government offered its protection to the Rajput rulers from the Pindaris and the Marathas. By the end of 1818 similar treaties had been executed between the other Rajput states and Britain. The Maratha Sindhia ruler of Gwalior gave up the district of Ajmer-Merwara to the British, and Maratha influence in Rajasthan came to an end.[341] Most of the Rajput princes remained loyal to Britain in the Revolt of 1857, and few political changes were made in Rajputana until Indian independence in 1947. The Rajputana Agency contained more than 20 princely states, most notable being Udaipur State, Jaipur State, Bikaner State and Jodhpur State.\\nAfter the fall of the Maratha Empire, many Maratha dynasties and states became vassals in a subsidiary alliance with the British. With the decline of the Sikh Empire, after the First Anglo-Sikh War in 1846, under the terms of the Treaty of Amritsar, the British government sold Kashmir to Maharaja Gulab Singh and the princely state of Jammu and Kashmir, the second-largest princely state in British India, was created by the Dogra dynasty.[342][343] While in eastern and north-eastern India, the Hindu and Buddhist states of Cooch Behar Kingdom, Twipra Kingdom and Kingdom of Sikkim were annexed by the British and made vassal princely state.\\nAfter the fall of the Vijayanagara Empire, Polygar states emerged in Southern India; and managed to weather invasions and flourished until the Polygar Wars, where they were defeated by the British East India Company forces.[344] Around the 18th century, the Kingdom of Nepal was formed by Rajput rulers.[345]\\n\\nEuropean exploration\\nMain article: Colonial India\\nThe route followed in Vasco da Gama\\'s first voyage (1497–1499)p\\nIn 1498, a Portuguese fleet under Vasco da Gama discovered a new sea route from Europe to India, which paved the way for direct Indo-European commerce. The Portuguese soon set up trading posts in Velha Goa, Damaon, Dio island, and Bombay. The Portuguese instituted the Goa Inquisition, where new Indian converts were punished for suspected heresy against Christianity and non-Christians were condemned.[346] Goa remained the main Portuguese territory until it was annexed by India in 1961.[347]\\nThe next to arrive were the Dutch, with their main base in Ceylon. They established ports in Malabar. However, their expansion into India was halted after their defeat in the Battle of Colachel by the Kingdom of Travancore during the Travancore-Dutch War. The Dutch never recovered from the defeat and no longer posed a large colonial threat to India.[348][349]\\nThe internal conflicts among Indian kingdoms gave opportunities to the European traders to gradually establish political influence and appropriate lands. Following the Dutch, the British — who set up in the west coast port of Surat in 1619 — and the French both established trading outposts in India. Although continental European powers controlled various coastal regions of southern and eastern India during the ensuing century, they eventually lost all their territories in India to the British, with the exception of the French outposts of Pondichéry and Chandernagore, and the Portuguese colonies of Goa, Daman and Diu.[350][351]\\n\\nEast India Company rule in India\\nMain articles: East India Company and Company rule in India\\nIndia under East India Company ruleIndia in 1765 and 1805 showing East India Company Territories in pinkIndia in 1837 and 1857 showing East India Company (pink) and other territories\\nThe English East India Company was founded in 1600. It gained a foothold in India with the establishment of a factory in Masulipatnam on the Eastern coast of India in 1611 and a grant of rights by the Mughal emperor Jahangir to establish a factory in Surat in 1612. In 1640, after receiving similar permission from the Vijayanagara ruler farther south, a second factory was established in Madras on the southeastern coast. The islet of Bom Bahia in present-day Mumbai (Bombay) was a Portuguese outpost not far from Surat. It was presented to Charles II of England as dowry in his marriage to Catherine of Braganza. Charles in turn leased Bombay to the Company in 1668. Two decades later, the company established a trade post in the River Ganges delta. During this time other companies established by the Portuguese, Dutch, French, and Danish were similarly expanding in the subcontinent.\\nThe company\\'s victory under Robert Clive in the 1757 Battle of Plassey and another victory in the 1764 Battle of Buxar (in Bihar), consolidated the company\\'s power, and forced emperor Shah Alam II to appoint it the diwan, or revenue collector, of Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa. The company thus became the de facto ruler of large areas of the lower Gangetic plain by 1773. It also proceeded by degrees to expand its dominions around Bombay and Madras. The Anglo-Mysore Wars (1766–99) and the Anglo-Maratha Wars (1772–1818) left it in control of large areas of India south of the Sutlej River. With the defeat of the Marathas, no native power represented a threat for the company any longer.[352]\\nThe expansion of the company\\'s power chiefly took two forms. The first of these was the outright annexation of Indian states and subsequent direct governance of the underlying regions that collectively came to comprise British India. The annexed regions included the North-Western Provinces (comprising Rohilkhand, Gorakhpur, and the Doab) (1801), Delhi (1803), Assam (Ahom Kingdom 1828) and Sindh (1843). Punjab, North-West Frontier Province, and Kashmir were annexed after the Anglo-Sikh Wars in 1849–56 (Period of tenure of Marquess of Dalhousie Governor General). However, Kashmir was immediately sold under the Treaty of Amritsar (1850) to the Dogra Dynasty of Jammu and thereby became a princely state. In 1854, Berar was annexed along with the state of Oudh two years later.[citation needed]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWarren Hastings, the first governor-general of Fort William (Bengal) who oversaw the company\\'s territories in India\\n\\n\\n\\nGold coin, minted 1835, with obverse showing the bust of William IV, king of United Kingdom from 26 June 1830 to 20 June 1837, and reverse marked \"Two mohurs\" in English (do ashrafi in Urdu) issued during Company rule in India\\n\\n\\n\\nPhotograph (1855) showing the construction of the Bhor Ghaut incline bridge, Bombay; the incline was conceived by George Clark, the Chief Engineer in the East India Company\\'s Government of Bombay\\n\\n\\nThe second form of asserting power involved treaties in which Indian rulers acknowledged the company\\'s hegemony in return for limited internal autonomy. Since the company operated under financial constraints, it had to set up political underpinnings for its rule.[353] The most important such support came from the subsidiary alliances with Indian princes.[353] In the early 19th century, the territories of these princes accounted for two-thirds of India.[353] When an Indian ruler who was able to secure his territory wanted to enter such an alliance, the company welcomed it as an economical method of indirect rule that did not involve the economic costs of direct administration or the political costs of gaining the support of alien subjects.[354]\\nIn return, the company undertook the \"defense of these subordinate allies and treated them with traditional respect and marks of honor.\"[354] Subsidiary alliances created the Princely States of the Hindu maharajas and the Muslim nawabs. Prominent among the princely states were Cochin (1791), Jaipur (1794), Travancore (1795), Hyderabad (1798), Mysore (1799), Cis-Sutlej Hill States (1815), Central India Agency (1819), Cutch and Gujarat Gaikwad territories (1819), Rajputana (1818),[355] and Bahawalpur (1833).\\n\\nIndian indenture system\\nMain article: Indian indenture system\\nThe Indian indenture system was an ongoing system of indenture, a form of debt bondage, by which 3.5\\xa0million Indians were transported to colonies of European powers to provide labour for the (mainly sugar) plantations. It started from the end of slavery in 1833 and continued until 1920. This resulted in the development of a large Indian diaspora that spread from the Caribbean to the Pacific Ocean and the growth of large Indo-Caribbean and Indo-African populations.\\n\\nLate modern period and contemporary history (1857–1947)\\nRebellion of 1857 and its consequences\\nMain article: Indian Rebellion of 1857\\n\\n\\n\\nLakshmibai, the Rani of Jhansi, one of the principal leaders of the rebellion who earlier had lost her kingdom as a result of the Doctrine of lapse.\\n\\n\\n\\nBahadur Shah Zafar, the last Mughal Emperor.

The spark that led to the mutiny was the issue of new gunpowder cartridges for the Enfield rifle, which was insensitive to local religious prohibition. The key mutineer was Mangal Pandey.[356] In addition, the underlying grievances over British taxation, the ethnic gulf between the British officers and their Indian troops and land annexations played a significant role in the rebellion. Within weeks after Pandey\\'s mutiny, dozens of units of the Indian army joined peasant armies in widespread rebellion. The rebel soldiers were later joined by Indian nobility, many of whom had lost titles and domains under the Doctrine of Lapse and felt that the company had interfered with a traditional system of inheritance. Rebel leaders such as Nana Sahib and the Rani of Jhansi belonged to this group.[357]\\nAfter the outbreak of the mutiny in Meerut, the rebels very quickly reached Delhi. The rebels had also captured large tracts of the North-Western Provinces and Awadh (Oudh). Most notably, in Awadh, the rebellion took on the attributes of a patriotic revolt against British presence.[358] However, the British East India Company mobilised rapidly with the assistance of friendly Princely states, but it took the British the better part of 1858 to suppress the rebellion. Due to the rebels being poorly equipped and having no outside support or funding, they were brutally subdued.[359]\\nIn the aftermath, all power was transferred from the British East India Company to the British Crown, which began to administer most of India as provinces. The Crown controlled the company\\'s lands directly and had considerable indirect influence over the rest of India, which consisted of the Princely states ruled by local royal families. There were officially 565 princely states in 1947, but only 21 had actual state governments, and only three were large (Mysore, Hyderabad, and Kashmir). They were absorbed into the independent nation in 1947–48.[360]\\n\\nBritish Raj (1858–1947)\\nMain article: British Raj\\nBritish RajThe British Indian Empire in 1909.

The Indian Penal Code came into being.[361] In education, Thomas Babington Macaulay had made schooling a priority for the Raj in 1835 and succeeded in implementing the use of English for instruction. By 1890 some 60,000 Indians had matriculated.[362] The Indian economy grew at about 1% per year from 1880 to 1920, and the population also grew at 1%. However, from 1910s Indian private industry began to grow significantly. India built a modern railway system in the late 19th century which was the fourth largest in the world.[363] Historians have been divided on issues of economic history, with the Nationalist school arguing that India was poorer due to British rule.[364]\\nIn 1905, Lord Curzon split the large province of Bengal into a largely Hindu western half and \"Eastern Bengal and Assam\", a largely Muslim eastern half. The British goal was said to be efficient administration but the people of Bengal were outraged at the apparent \"divide and rule\" strategy. It also marked the beginning of the organised anti-colonial movement. When the Liberal party in Britain came to power in 1906, he was removed. Bengal was reunified in 1911. The new Viceroy Gilbert Minto and the new Secretary of State for India John Morley consulted with Congress leaders on political reforms. The Morley-Minto reforms of 1909 provided for Indian membership of the provincial executive councils as well as the Viceroy\\'s executive council. The Imperial Legislative Council was enlarged from 25 to 60 members and separate communal representation for Muslims was established in a dramatic step towards representative and responsible government.[365] Several socio-religious organisations came into being at that time. Muslims set up the All India Muslim League in 1906 to protect the interests of the aristocratic Muslims. The Hindu Mahasabha and Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) sought to represent Hindu interests though the latter always claimed it to be a \"cultural\" organisation.[366] Sikhs founded the Shiromani Akali Dal in 1920.[367] However, the largest and oldest political party Indian National Congress, founded in 1885, attempted to keep a distance from the socio-religious movements and identity politics.[368]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTwo silver rupee coins issued by the British Raj in 1862 and 1886 respectively, the first in obverse showing a bust of Victoria, Queen, the second of Victoria, Empress.

This movement questioned existing orthodoxies, particularly with respect to women, marriage, the dowry system, the caste system, and religion. One of the earliest social movements that emerged during this time was the Young Bengal movement, which espoused rationalism and atheism as the common denominators of civil conduct among upper caste educated Hindus.[371] It played an important role in reawakening Indian minds and intellect across the Indian subcontinent.\\n\\nFamines\\nMain articles: Famine in India and Timeline of major famines in India during British rule\\nSee also: Demographics of India\\n\\n\\n\\nMap of famines in India during British Empire in year 1800–1885.\\n\\n\\n\\nEngraving from The Graphic, October 1877, showing the plight of animals as well as humans in Bellary district, Madras Presidency, British India during the Great Famine of 1876–1878\\n\\n\\n\\nGovernment famine relief, Ahmedabad, India, during the Indian famine of 1899–1900\\n\\n\\n\\nA picture of orphans who survived the Bengal famine of 1943, a man-made disaster by the British government\\n\\n\\nDuring British East India Company and British Crown rule, India experienced some of deadliest ever recorded famines. These famines, usually resulting from crop failures and often exacerbated by policies of the colonial government,[372] included the Great Famine of 1876–1878 in which 6.1\\xa0million to 10.3\\xa0million people died,[373] the Great Bengal famine of 1770 where between 1 and 10 million people died,[374][375] the Indian famine of 1899–1900 in which 1.25 to 10\\xa0million people died,[372] and the Bengal famine of 1943 where between 2.1 and 3.8 million people died.[376] The Third plague pandemic in the mid-19th century killed 10\\xa0million people in India.[377] Despite persistent diseases and famines, the population of the Indian subcontinent, which stood at up to 200\\xa0million in 1750,[378] had reached 389\\xa0million by 1941.[379]\\n\\nWorld War I\\nMain article: Indian Army during World War I\\n\\n\\n\\nIndian Cavalry on the Western front 1914\\n\\n\\n\\nIndian cavalry from the Deccan Horse during the Battle of Bazentin Ridge in 1916.\\n\\n\\n\\nIndian Army gunners (probably 39th Battery) with 3.7-inch mountain howitzers, Jerusalem 1917\\n\\n\\n\\nIndia Gate is a memorial to 70,000 soldiers of the British Indian Army who died in the period 1914–21 in the First World War\\n\\n\\nDuring World War I, over 800,000 volunteered for the army, and more than 400,000 volunteered for non-combat roles, compared with the pre-war annual recruitment of about 15,000 men.[380] The Army saw early action on the Western Front at the First Battle of Ypres. After a year of front-line duty, sickness and casualties had reduced the Indian Corps to the point where it had to be withdrawn. Nearly 700,000 Indians fought the Turks in the Mesopotamian campaign. Indian formations were also sent to East Africa, Egypt, and Gallipoli.[381]\\nIndian Army and Imperial Service Troops fought during the Sinai and Palestine Campaign\\'s defence of the Suez Canal in 1915, at Romani in 1916 and to Jerusalem in 1917. India units occupied the Jordan Valley and after the German spring offensive they became the major force in the Egyptian Expeditionary Force during the Battle of Megiddo and in the Desert Mounted Corps\\' advance to Damascus and on to Aleppo. Other divisions remained in India guarding the North-West Frontier and fulfilling internal security obligations.\\nOne million Indian troops served abroad during the war. In total, 74,187 died,[382] and another 67,000 were wounded.[383] The roughly 90,000 soldiers who died fighting in World War I and the Afghan Wars are commemorated by the India Gate.\\n\\nWorld War II\\nMain article: India in World War II\\n\\n\\n\\nGeneral Claude Auchinleck (right), Commander-in-Chief of the Indian Army, with the then Viceroy Wavell (centre) and General Montgomery (left)\\n\\n\\n\\nIndian women training for Air Raid Precautions (ARP) duties in Bombay in 1942\\n\\n\\n\\nIndian infantrymen of the 7th Rajput Regiment about to go on patrol on the Arakan front in Burma, 1944\\n\\n\\n\\nThe stamp series \"Victory\" issued by the Government of British India to commemorate allied victory in World War II\\n\\n\\nBritish India officially declared war on Nazi Germany in September 1939.[384] The British Raj, as part of the Allied Nations, sent over two and a half million volunteer soldiers to fight under British command against the Axis powers. Additionally, several Princely States provided large donations to support the Allied campaign. India also provided the base for American operations in support of China in the China Burma India Theatre.\\nIndians fought throughout the world, including in the European theatre against Germany, in North Africa against Germany and Italy, against the Italians in East Africa, in the Middle East against the Vichy French, in the South Asian region defending India against the Japanese and fighting the Japanese in Burma. Indians also aided in liberating British colonies such as Singapore and Hong Kong after the Japanese surrender in August 1945. Over 87,000 soldiers from the subcontinent died in World War II.\\nThe Indian National Congress denounced Nazi Germany but would not fight it or anyone else until India was independent. Congress launched the Quit India Movement in August 1942, refusing to co-operate in any way with the government until independence was granted. The government immediately arrested over 60,000 national and local Congress leaders. The Muslim League rejected the Quit India movement and worked closely with the Raj authorities.\\nSubhas Chandra Bose (also called Netaji) broke with Congress and tried to form a military alliance with Germany or Japan to gain independence. The Germans assisted Bose in the formation of the Indian Legion;[385] however, it was Japan that helped him revamp the Indian National Army (INA), after the First Indian National Army under Mohan Singh was dissolved. The INA fought under Japanese direction, mostly in Burma.[386] Bose also headed the Provisional Government of Free India (or Azad Hind), a government-in-exile based in Singapore.[387][388]\\nBy 1942, neighbouring Burma was invaded by Japan, which by then had already captured the Indian territory of Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Japan gave nominal control of the islands to the Provisional Government of Free India on 21 October 1943, and in the following March, the Indian National Army with the help of Japan crossed into India and advanced as far as Kohima in Nagaland. This advance on the mainland of the Indian subcontinent reached its farthest point on Indian territory, retreating from the Battle of Kohima in June and from that of Imphal on 3 July 1944.\\nThe region of Bengal in British India suffered a devastating famine during 1940–1943. An estimated 2.1–3 million died from the famine, frequently characterised as \"man-made\",[389] with most sources asserting that wartime colonial policies exacerbated the crisis.[390]\\n\\nIndian independence movement (1885–1947)\\nMain article: Indian independence movement\\nSee also: Indian independence activists and Pakistan Movement\\n\\n\\n\\nThe first session of the Indian National Congress in 1885.  A. O. Hume, the founder, is shown in the middle (third row from the front). The Congress was the first modern nationalist movement to emerge in the British Empire in Asia and Africa.[391]\\n\\n\\n\\nFront page of the Tribune (25 March 1931), reporting the execution of Bhagat Singh, Rajguru and Sukhdev by the British for the murder of 21-year-old police officer J. P. Saunders. Bhagat Singh quickly became a folk hero of the Indian independence movement.\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom the late 19th century, and especially after 1920, under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi (right), the Congress became the principal leader of the Indian independence movement.[392] Gandhi is shown here with Jawaharlal Nehru, later the first prime minister of India.\\n\\n\\nThe numbers of British in India were small,[393] yet they were able to rule 52% of the Indian subcontinent directly and exercise considerable leverage over the princely states that accounted for 48% of the area.[394]\\nOne of the most important events of the 19th century was the rise of Indian nationalism,[395] leading Indians to seek first \"self-rule\" and later \"complete independence\". However, historians are divided over the causes of its rise. Probable reasons include a \"clash of interests of the Indian people with British interests\",[395] \"racial discriminations\",[396] and \"the revelation of India\\'s past\".[397]\\nThe first step toward Indian self-rule was the appointment of councillors to advise the British viceroy in 1861 and the first Indian was appointed in 1909. Provincial Councils with Indian members were also set up. The councillors\\' participation was subsequently widened into legislative councils. The British built a large British Indian Army, with the senior officers all British and many of the troops from small minority groups such as Gurkhas from Nepal and Sikhs.[398] The civil service was increasingly filled with natives at the lower levels, with the British holding the more senior positions.[399]\\nBal Gangadhar Tilak, an Indian nationalist leader, declared Swaraj (home rule) as the destiny of the nation. His popular sentence \"Swaraj is my birthright, and I shall have it\"[400] became the source of inspiration. Tilak was backed by rising public leaders like Bipin Chandra Pal and Lala Lajpat Rai, who held the same point of view, notably they advocated the Swadeshi movement involving the boycott of imported items and the use of Indian-made goods;[401] the triumvirate were popularly known as Lal Bal Pal. In 1907, the Congress was split into two factions: The radicals, led by Tilak, advocated civil agitation and direct revolution to overthrow the British Empire and the abandonment of all things British. The moderates, led by leaders like Dadabhai Naoroji and Gopal Krishna Gokhale, on the other hand, wanted reform within the framework of British rule.[401]\\nThe partition of Bengal in 1905 further increased the revolutionary movement for Indian independence. The disenfranchisement lead some to take violent action.\\nThe British themselves adopted a \"carrot and stick\" approach in response to renewed nationalist demands. The means of achieving the proposed measure were later enshrined in the Government of India Act 1919, which introduced the principle of a dual mode of administration, or diarchy, in which elected Indian legislators and appointed British officials shared power.[402] In 1919, Colonel Reginald Dyer ordered his troops to fire their weapons on peaceful protestors, including unarmed women and children, resulting in the Jallianwala Bagh massacre; which led to the Non-cooperation Movement of 1920–1922. The massacre was a decisive episode towards the end of British rule in India.[403]\\nFrom 1920 leaders such as Mahatma Gandhi began highly popular mass movements to campaign against the British Raj using largely peaceful methods. The Gandhi-led independence movement opposed the British rule using non-violent methods like non-co-operation, civil disobedience and economic resistance. However, revolutionary activities against the British rule took place throughout the Indian subcontinent and some others adopted a militant approach like the Hindustan Republican Association, that sought to overthrow British rule by armed struggle.\\nThe All India Azad Muslim Conference gathered in Delhi in April 1940 to voice its support for an independent and united India.[404] Its members included several Islamic organisations in India, as well as 1,400 nationalist Muslim delegates.[405][406][407] The pro-separatist All-India Muslim League worked to try to silence those nationalist Muslims who stood against the partition of India, often using \"intimidation and coercion\".[406][407] The murder of the All India Azad Muslim Conference leader Allah Bakhsh Soomro also made it easier for the pro-separatist All-India Muslim League to demand the creation of a Pakistan.[407]\\n\\nAfter World War II (c. 1946–1947)\\n\\n\\n\"A moment comes, which comes but rarely in history, when we step out from the old to the new; when an age ends; and when the soul of a nation long suppressed finds utterance.\"\\n\\n\\n\\xa0— From, Tryst with destiny, a speech given by Jawaharlal Nehru to the Constituent Assembly of India on the eve of independence, 14 August 1947.[408]\\n\\nIn January 1946, several mutinies broke out in the armed services, starting with that of RAF servicemen frustrated with their slow repatriation. The mutinies came to a head with mutiny of the Royal Indian Navy in Bombay in February 1946, followed by others in Calcutta, Madras, and Karachi. The mutinies were rapidly suppressed. In early 1946, new elections were called and Congress candidates won in eight of the eleven provinces.\\nLate in 1946, the Labour government decided to end British rule of India, and in early 1947 it announced its intention of transferring power no later than June 1948 and participating in the formation of an interim government.\\nAlong with the desire for independence, tensions between Hindus and Muslims had also been developing over the years. Muslim League leader Muhammad Ali Jinnah proclaimed 16 August 1946 as Direct Action Day, with the stated goal of highlighting, peacefully, the demand for a Muslim homeland in British India, which resulted in the outbreak of the cycle of violence that would be later called the \"Great Calcutta Killing of August 1946\". The communal violence spread to Bihar, Noakhali in Bengal, Garhmukteshwar in the United Provinces, and on to Rawalpindi in March 1947 in which Sikhs and Hindus were attacked or driven out by Muslims.\\n\\nLiteracy in India grew very slowly until independence in 1947.

In particular, the partition of the Punjab and Bengal led to rioting between Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs in these provinces and spread to other nearby regions, leaving some 500,000 dead. The police and army units were largely ineffective. The British officers were gone, and the units were beginning to tolerate if not actually indulge in violence against their religious enemies.[409][410][411] Also, this period saw one of the largest mass migrations anywhere in modern history, with a total of 12\\xa0million Hindus, Sikhs and Muslims moving between the newly created nations of India and Pakistan (which gained independence on 15 and 14 August 1947 respectively).[410] In 1971, Bangladesh, formerly East Pakistan and East Bengal, seceded from Pakistan.[412]\\n\\nSee also\\n\\nAdivasi\\nEarly Indians\\nIndia (Herodotus)\\nList of Indian periods\\nThe Cambridge History of India\\nOutline of ancient India\\nTimeline of Indian history\\nBy topic\\nCulture\\nEconomy\\nHistoriography\\nForeign relations\\nMaritime\\nLanguages\\nMilitary\\nPhysical culture\\nMedieval taxation\\n\\nReferences\\nNotes\\n\\n\\n^ The \"First urbanisation\" was the Indus Valley Civilisation.[76]\\n\\n^ Many historians consider Attock to be the final frontier of the Maratha Empire[332]\\n\\n\\nCitations\\n\\n\\n^ Michael D.

The Friday Times. However, the book is a tribute to the role of one Muslim leader who steadfastly opposed the Partition of India: the Sindhi leader Allah Bakhsh Soomro. Allah Bakhsh belonged to a landed family. He founded the Sindh People\\'s Party in 1934, which later came to be known as \\'Ittehad\\' or \\'Unity Party\\'. ... Allah Bakhsh was totally opposed to the Muslim League\\'s demand for the creation of Pakistan through a division of India on a religious basis. Consequently, he established the Azad Muslim Conference. In its Delhi session held during April 27–30, 1940 some 1,400 delegates took part. They belonged mainly to the lower castes and working class. The famous scholar of Indian Islam, Wilfred Cantwell Smith, feels that the delegates represented a \\'majority of India\\'s Muslims\\'. Among those who attended the conference were representatives of many Islamic theologians and women also took part in the deliberations ... Shamsul Islam argues that the All-India Muslim League at times used intimidation and coercion to silence any opposition among Muslims to its demand for Partition. He calls such tactics of the Muslim League as a \\'Reign of Terror\\'. He gives examples from all over India including the NWFP where the Khudai Khidmatgars remain opposed to the Partition of India.\\n\\n^ a b c Ali, Afsar (17 July 2017). \"Partition of India and Patriotism of Indian Muslims\".

The murderous mobs were well supplied with arms, such as daggers, swords, spears and fire-arms.

For example, one\\nof the largest networks, Strava, has over 100 million registered\\nusers [50]. These fitness tracking social networks allow users to\\nrecord their sports activities, and share their tracks and achieve-\\nments with friends and other users of the platform, promoting\\nenjoyment and motivation [7]. The tracks represent the routes that\\nthe user followed during the activity. While sharing tracks forms\\npart of the attraction of these networks, this, however, comes with\\nprivacy and security risks, as they might reveal sensitive informa-\\ntion, such as the user’s regular routes or visited locations, to people\\nwith ill intentions. Several past incidents drew attention to the\\ndangers of sharing this data with the public, from revealing secret\\nmilitary locations [25], enabling theft of exercise equipment [10],\\nrevealing the identity of nearby athletes [45], to doxing users [39].\\nTo limit the potential risks of sharing information, all major\\nnetworks offer privacy controls that limit the amount of shared\\ninformation, as well as control whom information is shared with.\\nOne notable privacy control is the endpoint privacy zone (EPZ). An\\nEPZ allows users to hide track portions near protected (sensitive) lo-\\ncations, such as their home or work address, from all activity tracks\\nshown to other users. This measure aims to prevent harassment\\nand stalking at commonly visited locations [54], or criminal activity\\nsuch as theft at the protected locations [10]. Most commonly, EPZ\\nimplementations balance an increase in privacy with usability, no-\\ntably in terms of tracking fitness achievements, as features such as\\nleaderboards may only be available for publicly viewable data [14].\\nMoreover, activities usually still contain the full traveled distance,\\neven for the portions hidden by the EPZ. The user who created the\\nactivity can also still access the full activity, as shown in Figure 1.\\nOne implementation of EPZs hides track portions inside a circle\\nwith the sensitive location as its center and a user-configurable\\nradius. However, this implementation has fallen out of favor, as\\ngiven one or more tracks for one user, it is possible to reconstruct\\nthe privacy zone (i.e., the radius) and find the sensitive location\\n \\n801'),\n",

The interface dis-\\nplays the track ➀, the total traveled distance ➁ and accumu-\\nlated distance at each point (through the elevation profile\\n➂). Part of the track is marked as ‘hidden’ ➃, as it is cloaked\\nby an EPZ. Only the owner of the activity sees that part of\\nthe activity is hidden; other users only see the visible part\\nwithout any indication that another part is hidden.\\n(i.e., the center) through basic geometric inference. In 2018, Has-\\nsan et al. showed that this EPZ implementation is vulnerable to\\nautomated inference attacks [24]. In 2022, Mink et al. showed that\\nhuman users can visually infer privacy zones that use this imple-\\nmentation [35].\\nWe confirm through a systematic analysis that major fitness\\ntracking social networks implemented some countermeasures in\\nan attempt to better protect sensitive locations from these basic\\ninference attacks [24, 35]. These countermeasures include those\\nproposed by Hassan et al. [24]: larger radii, noise addition at the\\nEPZ boundary, and spatial cloaking where the EPZ center is ran-\\ndomly shifted. However, some usability trade-offs are made, such\\nas allowing small or only fixed radii, or not requiring spatial cloak-\\ning. Moreover, some fitness tracking social networks still do not\\nimplement EPZs at all.\\nIn this paper, we are the first to show that these newer imple-\\nmentations of EPZs remain highly vulnerable to the discovery of\\nthe purportedly protected location, even when countermeasures\\nsuch as spatial cloaking are applied. Our novel inference attack\\nleverages two inputs that enable a regression analysis resulting in\\nthe protected location for an EPZ. First, the road network restricts\\nthe possible paths that a user could have taken inside an EPZ. Sec-\\nond, the activity metadata leaks the exact distances of the paths\\nthat were traveled inside the EPZ. We then predict the protected\\nlocation as the point where the distances of the possible and actual\\npaths match best across multiple activities.\\nWe find through an evaluation on 1.4 million real-world Strava\\nactivities that our attack can deanonymize protected locations for\\nup to 85% of EPZs. Larger EPZ radii are more effective at preventing\\nlocation inference and preserving user privacy, but even for very\\nlarge radii (1 km), deanonymization remains possible for 55% of\\nEPZs. Through a detailed analysis of the sensitivity of our attack,\\nwe find that higher geographic activity diversity and lower street\\ndensity benefit its performance.\\nWe propose and evaluate six countermeasures that can restore\\nthe anonymity of locations protected by EPZs to a varying degree.\\nWe find that generalization (rounding) of reported activity distances\\nwould be the most effective countermeasure, although it comes with\\na significant negative usability impact, as fitness tracking social\\nnetworks are attractive precisely because they allow tracking small\\nachievement differences accurately. Other countermeasures may be\\nless invasive, but are then also less effective at improving privacy.\\nInterestingly, certain interventions such as regenerating EPZs may\\nactually improve our attack’s efficacy, as they provide more data\\nfrom which the protected location can be more reliably inferred.\\nCountermeasures must therefore be carefully evaluated in order\\nto minimize their negative impact on usability and privacy. We\\ndisclosed our findings and proposed countermeasures to the major\\nvulnerable fitness tracking social networks.\\nIn summary, we make the following contributions:\\n•We conduct a systematic analysis on current EPZ implemen-\\ntations for the most popular fitness tracking social networks.\\n•We develop a proof-of-concept attack that infers protected\\nlocations inside EPZs through regression analysis on the\\nroad network and leaked covered distances (Section 4).\\n•We evaluate our attack on 1.4 million real-world Strava ac-\\ntivities (Section 5). We discover sensitive locations for up to\\n85% of EPZs, and find that our attack performs better with\\ngeographically dispersed activities on sparse street grids\\n(Section 6).\\n•We propose six countermeasures to improve the anonymity\\nprovided by EPZs and discuss their trade-offs between pri-\\nvacy and usability (Section 7).\\n2 FITNESS TRACKING SOCIAL NETWORKS\\nOur work concerns fitness tracking social networks, where users can\\nrecord their workouts and share them with others. Users typically\\nrecord workouts using a GPS-enabled smartphone or wearable de-\\nvice and upload them in the form of activities. An activity contains\\na track, i.e., the route that the user took, represented by a series\\nof points (coordinates). The activity also reports the total distance\\ntraveled, as well as the accumulated distance at each point of the\\ntrack, along with other metadata such as the duration, pace, ele-\\nvation profile, heart rate, etc. Finally, many FTSNs define specific\\nstretches of road (e.g., ‘segments’ on Strava) where they maintain a\\nleaderboard of the fastest athletes across these stretches. Figure 1\\nshows what a fully developed activity may look like.\\nMost networks offer privacy controls that let users hide all activ-\\nities from other users (i.e., private profile) or mark specific activities\\nas hidden. Using these controls can severely limit the functionality\\nof social features for the affected activities. For example, activities\\nthat are marked as private by their owners cannot be viewed by\\nother users and may be ineligible for inclusion on segment leader-\\nboards and in challenges [14, 7]. However, networks such as Strava\\n \\n802'),\n",

EPZs allow\\nusers to hide the most sensitive parts of the tracks in their activities,\\nas they could otherwise reveal frequently visited locations such as\\nthe user’s home or workplace. Activities with EPZs applied to them\\ncan still be shared, but the hidden parts of the tracks may still be\\nineligible for performance comparisons, so users may be inclined\\nto disable or at least severely limit them. We discuss these zones in\\nmore detail in Section 3.\\n3 ENDPOINT PRIVACY ZONES\\nMost FTSNs allow their users to hide a privacy-sensitive location\\nby letting them define an Endpoint Privacy Zone (EPZ) around that\\nlocation. One location corresponds to exactly one EPZ, but a user\\ncan configure multiple locations that each have their own EPZ.\\nEPZs can be regenerated at any time and are applied retroactively\\nto all the activities of the owner. The goal of the EPZ is then to hide\\nthose parts of the track that might reveal the sensitive location, i.e.,\\nare near this location. Only the owner of the activity 𝑎can view\\nthe full track, including its actual start and finish points (together\\nthe ‘endpoints’), as well as the layout of the EPZ itself (shown\\nin Figure 2a). Other users only see a cloaked activity 𝑎′as defined\\nin Definition 1 and depicted in Figure 2b. Concretely, in such a\\ncloaked activity all points from the start of the track until the first\\ntime the owner leaves the EPZ are hidden, as are all points from the\\nlast time the owner enters the EPZ until the end of the track. The\\nother users therefore observe cloaked start and finish points. Note\\nthat if the owner passes through the EPZ but does not start or end\\nthere, that track portion through the EPZ is not hidden. Moreover,\\neven though the points inside the EPZ are hidden, the accumulated\\ndistance for points outside the EPZ as well as the total distance\\nare not changed. This forms the basis for our attack described in\\nSection 4.\\nDefinition 1 (Endpoint Privacy Zone). Let protected location 𝑝𝑠 =\\n(𝑥𝑠,𝑦𝑠)be a point in the Cartesian plane 𝐶, and 𝑎 be an activity\\nroute of𝑛points {𝑝1,...,𝑝 𝑛}. We denote𝑝1 as the actual start point\\nand 𝑝𝑛 as the actual finish point.\\nLet 𝐸𝑃𝑍 be a subplane of 𝐶. Enforcing 𝐸𝑃𝑍 on activity 𝑎results\\nin a cloaked activity 𝑎′= {𝑝𝑗,...,𝑝 𝑚}with 1 ≤𝑗 ≤𝑚 ≤𝑛, where\\n𝑝𝑗 is the first point and 𝑝𝑚 the last point of the activity route that\\ndoes not lie in 𝐸𝑃𝑍. We denote 𝑝𝑗 as the cloaked start point and\\n𝑝𝑚 as the cloaked finish point.\\nIn Table 1, we list the supported EPZ parameters of popular\\nFTSNs. Most FTSNs use circular EPZs and let the user select the\\nradius of the circle from a set of fixed radii. Hassan et al. inferred\\nprotected locations using publicly available information such as\\nthe advertised start and finish point of the user’s activity [24].\\nThe researchers demonstrated that, given multiple endpoints of\\nprotected activities and the circular layout of the EPZ, an adversary\\ncould reconstruct the EPZ and expose the protected location (i.e.,\\nthe center point of the EPZ). To deal with the aforementioned\\nattack, some FTSNs apply spatial cloaking by adding a random\\ntranslation to the center of the EPZs [23], resulting in a cloaked\\ncircular EPZ as defined in Definition 2. An adversary could still\\ndetermine the parameters of the cloaked EPZ, but cannot infer the\\nprotected location, since the protected location and the EPZ center\\ndo not match. Komoot uses a randomly shaped polygon around\\nthe protected location, rather than a circular EPZ. This makes it\\nmore difficult for an attacker to deduce the shape of the privacy\\nzone [28]. Map My Tracks has an automatic privacy zone detection\\ntool, lowering the bar for users to create a privacy zone [37]. This\\nautomatic tool scans all new activity endpoints in order to identify\\nregular start and finish locations. If such locations are detected, a\\n(circular) EPZ is enforced on all activities retroactively. This feature\\nis enabled by default but can be disabled by the user at any time.\\nDefinition 2 (Cloaked Circular Endpoint Privacy Zone).

Crucially, this attack is\\nenabled by the availability of exact accumulated and total distances\\nfor cloaked activities, revealing the distance traveled inside the\\nEPZ. The intuition behind our attack is that if a victim has multiple\\nactivities in one or more cardinal directions (which we denote as\\n‘entry gates’), we can use these distances to limit the locations\\nwhere the victim could have started or ended their activities. For\\nexample, consider the three activities in Figure 3 indicated in blue,\\norange and green. While only the owner of the activities can see\\nthe dashed portions of the activities inside the EPZ, the attacker\\nstill knows their lengths. With these lengths and given the street\\ngrid, an adversary is able to construct all paths the victim could\\nhave covered inside the EPZ. Given these paths, the endpoint of\\nthe activities is at risk of being inferred using the intersection\\nof multiple distinct paths inside the EPZ. We divide the breaking\\nof privacy zones into two subproblems: first, identifying EPZs to\\nreduce the search space, and second, finding the protected location\\ninside those EPZs through regression analysis.\\n4.1 Threat Model\\nFor this work, we consider an attacker who attempts to infer the\\nprotected locations of another user by only using the publicly avail-\\nable information that a regular user would be entitled to view, as\\ndisplayed by the FTSN. The adversary has exactly the same rights\\nas a regular user and cannot access any information by any other\\nmeans, e.g., by infiltrating the FTSN’s servers. The attacker can\\ntarget either one specific user or the entire userbase of the network.\\nThe attacker is reasonably technically sophisticated, capable of\\ninspecting network traffic to retrieve the activity metadata (e.g., in\\nbrowser developer tools), download map data and run the infer-\\nence algorithm. This attacker model is similar to that of Hassan\\net al. [24]. Mink et al. [35] consider a less technically skilled at-\\ntacker, who infers protected locations visually from the activity\\nview on the network’s website. In the context of intimate partner\\nviolence, Tseng et al. [52] found evidence of forum discussions\\nwhere users collaborate on technically sophisticated attacks. Given\\npossibly similar motivations to deanonymize protected locations\\n(e.g., stalking), even less technically skilled attackers could receive\\nsupport in successfully deploying the inference attack.\\n4.2 Identifying EPZs\\nAs a preliminary step for our attack, we seek to identify the EPZs of a\\nuser. This step resembles the attack developed by Hassan et al. [24],\\nwhere identifying the EPZ (by fitting a circle) reveals the protected\\nlocation. However, this is no longer sufficient for our inference\\nattack, as networks use EPZs with countermeasures against Hassan\\net al. ’s attack. In our case, this step is also not strictly necessary\\nfor our attack to be effective, as we can search candidate loca-\\ntions throughout the entire street grid regardless of the EPZ layout.\\nHowever, this step constrains the search space, which improves\\nthe attack’s efficacy and computational performance by remov-\\ning points that are ineligible as protected location. Moreover, if\\none search space contains multiple non-overlapping EPZs\\n1, our\\nregression-based approach for location discovery (see Algorithm 2)\\nmay return a location outside these EPZs, i.e., in fact ineligible to be\\na protected location. Some restriction is therefore advantageous, al-\\nthough it does not need to be precise. Nevertheless, with knowledge\\nof how EPZs are configured on a specific platform (see Section 3),\\nthe adversary can identify the distinct EPZs more precisely.\\nAs an example of an EPZ identification algorithm, we present\\nAlgorithm 1 that discovers circular EPZs. Such EPZs are used by\\nmost services (Table 1). This algorithm identifies multiple circular\\nEPZs, each with different protected locations and parameters, from\\nthe set 𝐴 of all cloaked activities of one user. The input to our\\nalgorithm is the set 𝑃 of all start points 𝑝𝑗 for cloaked activities\\nthat started inside an EPZ and all finish points𝑝𝑚 for activities that\\nended in an EPZ, as they are shown to the adversary (a non-owner\\nuser)2. We then adapt the 𝑘-means clustering algorithm [30] to\\noutput the distinct circular EPZ layouts based on these start and\\nfinish points, iteratively increasing𝑘until every EPZ is represented\\nby exactly one cluster. For a given 𝑘, the algorithm initializes 𝑘\\nclusters 𝑆𝑖 (𝑖 = 1,...,𝑘 ) with randomly selected points from 𝑃. In\\nsubsequent iterations, our algorithm assigns each point 𝑝 to the\\ncluster 𝑆𝑖 with the lowest Euclidean distance to the least squared\\ncircle 𝐶𝑖 fitted between the points of that cluster, and fitted such\\nthat none of the points lay inside𝐶𝑖 (a circular EPZ cloaks all points\\nwithin the circle, cf. Definition 2). This cost function differs from\\nregular k-means, where the distance from points to the mean of\\ntheir cluster is minimized. The radius of the fitted circle should be\\nbounded by the notion of the minimum and maximum radius of an\\n1In case the EPZs overlap, we consider the union as one EPZ with multiple protected\\nlocations. Bootstrapping the activities for the input to Algorithm 2 will then proba-\\nbilistically return these two locations (see also Section 6.2).\\n2Note that we convert the geodetic coordinates (latitude and longitude) from the FTSN\\nactivity data, to plane coordinates (Universal Transverse Mercator) by projecting them\\nonto a Cartesian plane, as established in Definition 1.\\n \\n804'),\n",

We generalize this to atotal distance sce-\\nnario in which only the combined cloaked distance is available,\\ni.e., without distinct distances for the start and finish point. If only\\none of the points lies inside a privacy zone (as could be inferred\\nusing Algorithm 1), the total distance trivially reduces to the inner\\ndistance, as this inner distance at the single cloaked side is equal to\\nthe reported distance discrepancy. Our data characteristics in Sec-\\ntion 5.2 show that 35.08% of activities only start or finish inside\\nan EPZ, but not both. When both endpoints are cloaked, there is\\nan unresolvable degree of freedom in the division of the distance\\ndiscrepancy over the start and finish points. In this case, the activ-\\nity is discarded, and the attack is run on the remaining activities.\\nOur analysis in Section 6.3 shows that our attack still performs\\nwell in this total distance scenario, with only a minor performance\\nreduction compared to the inner distance scenario.\\nIn an ideal context, the endpoints for the reported distances of\\nall activities would overlap at exactly one node of the road graph\\n(i.e., the protected location) if the following idealistic assumptions\\nwere to hold:\\nA1. The cloaked start and finish points intersect with the edge\\nof the EPZ.\\nA2. A protected location is always located along a path, i.e., on a\\nnode inside 𝐺.\\nA3. The victim starts and finishes their activity at the single\\nprotected location inside a distinct EPZ.\\nA4. Inside the EPZ, the victim uses the shortest path on the street\\ngrid from or to the protected location.\\nHowever, in practice these assumptions do not always hold. For\\nexample, a user might only start recording their activity 50 meters\\naway from their protected location, and GPS tracking errors will\\ncause a track to deviate from (the shortest path on) the street grid.\\nOverall, for a 200m EPZ, 54% of all activities in our real-world\\ndata set (Section 5) violate at least one idealistic assumption. Our\\napproach is explicitly designed to be robust against these violations,\\ni.e., it works even in non-ideal settings. We develop a four-step\\nalgorithm that provides a sufficiently correct solution even though\\nthese assumptions from the ideal context do not hold, as we show\\nin our real-world evaluation (Section 6).\\n4.3.1 Calculate Theoretical Distances. The algorithm starts by map\\nmatching (‘snapping’) all endpoints to the road graph. For each\\npoint 𝑝𝑙 ∈𝑃, the algorithm identifies the node𝑣𝑝𝑙 ∈𝑉 with the low-\\nest Euclidean distance 𝑑𝑝𝑙 to 𝑝𝑙. If this distance exceeds a threshold\\n𝜏𝑠𝑛𝑎𝑝, the algorithm discards this point since it is uncertain if the\\nroad was used. 𝜏𝑠𝑛𝑎𝑝 could be empirically selected based on the\\nmean GPS sampling distance. 𝑃′represents the set of map matched\\npoints 𝑣𝑝𝑙 that are retained. The algorithm then computes the short-\\nest path lengths from 𝑣𝑝𝑙 (recall: a point near the edge of the EPZ)\\nto all other nodes 𝑉 inside the EPZ using the Dijkstra single source\\nmultiple destination algorithm [16]. The lengths are collected into\\na distance matrix 𝑇 of size |𝑃′|×|𝑉|. These lengths represent the\\n‘theoretical’ distances from the cloaked map matched endpoints\\nat the edge of the EPZ to nodes within the EPZ (i.e., possible pro-\\ntected locations), if the track were to exactly follow the road graph.\\nHowever, GPS errors and the variation across the width of a road\\ncause the actual user tracks to deviate from this road graph.

Endpoints will not exactly intersect the circular EPZ,\\nas the first (last) point outside the EPZ will be the first (last)\\nvisible point. No endpoints therefore lie inside the EPZ.\\nregression analysis in the last step of our algorithm addresses these\\ndeviations when predicting the protected location.\\n4.3.2 Identify Entry Gates. The exact intersection point of an activ-\\nity and the EPZ is seldom recoverable, violating Assumption A1. Def-\\ninition 1 states that the activity gets cut off at the first point out-\\nside the EPZ rather than at the exact intersection. In combination\\nwith low GPS sampling rates (to save battery) and GPS errors, this\\ncloaked endpoint can be distant from the edge of the EPZ, par-\\nticularly as the speed of an activity increases. Figure 5 shows an\\nexample of this scenario, where the endpoints of an activity do not\\nexactly intersect with the circular EPZ.\\nWe cluster the cloaked endpoints 𝑝𝑙 to form dense regions. We\\nrefer to these regions as entry gates, and we assume that each entry\\ngate 𝑌𝑗 consists of endpoints 𝑃𝑌𝑗 ⊆𝑃′where the intersection point\\nof the actual track with the edge of the EPZ is shared. In Figure 5,\\nthe points that form one entry gate are displayed in the same color.\\nThe most suitable algorithm for geospatial data is DBSCAN [19], a\\ndensity-based clustering algorithm, since it does not require a priori\\nknowledge of the number of clusters (i.e., entry gates).

Next, we discard outlier end-\\npoints that could incorrectly skew the prediction of the protected\\nlocation. Such outliers may stem from activities where the user\\nstarted or finished far away from the protected location (violating\\nAssumption A3), or did not follow the shortest path within the EPZ\\n(violating Assumption A4).\\nThe algorithm starts by discarding points 𝑣𝑝𝑙 with a reported\\ndistance 𝑜𝑙 larger than the maximum theoretical distance 𝑇𝑙,max\\nfrom 𝑣𝑝𝑙 to a node inside the EPZ, i.e., the maximum of the matrix\\nrow 𝑇𝑙,∗. We do this because these activities could never cover the\\nshortest path towards the protected location.

Concretely, we consider a deviation of\\nmore than three standard deviations from the mean significant.\\n4.3.4 Predict Protected Location. As the points that constitute one\\nentry gate do not overlap exactly, we use least absolute deviation\\n(LAD) regression to predict the most likely protected location across\\nall these diffuse entry gates. For each node 𝑣𝑙 inside the EPZ (i.e.,\\neach possible protected location), the algorithm calculates the sum\\nof absolute differences across all points 𝑣𝑝𝑙 ∈𝑃′between the ob-\\nserved distance 𝑜𝑙 and the theoretical shortest path distance 𝑇𝑣𝑝𝑙,𝑣𝑙\\nbetween 𝑣𝑝𝑙 and 𝑣𝑙. The final predicted protected location is then the\\nnode 𝑣𝑙 ∈𝑉 where this sum is minimal. Note that we retain Assump-\\ntion A2 here, as the predicted location will always be located on the\\nroad graph. However, users may start or finish their activity away\\nfrom the road, e.g., on their private grounds. We offset this violation\\nof our assumption through the definition of an error threshold 𝜏𝑒,\\nbelow which the protected location is sufficiently closely predicted\\nto deanonymize the user. In Appendix A, we empirically determine\\nan acceptable error threshold based on real-world activities.\\n5 DATA COLLECTION\\nA large pool of real user data from a fitness tracking social network\\nis required to further evaluate the plausibility of our attack against\\nstate-of-the-art EPZ implementations.

However, due to delays in\\nuploading activities to Strava, the temporal order is not sequential.\\nWe identify the first activity ID globally assigned after 11 July 2021\\n00:00 UTC.

For this (public) activity, we identify the user who\\ncreated it. This ultimately provides us with a randomly generated,\\nrepresentative sample of 4,000 users.\\nFor each user in our sample, we retrieve user information (i.e.,\\nnationality) and the IDs of their public activities with map data. For\\nthis, we scrape and parse theoverview section of the athlete’s profile\\npage4 using Selenium [47]. Then, for each activity (ID), we extract\\nits total distance and type from the strava.com/activities/ID\\npage. We also collect the elevation profile including the GPS track\\npoints as coordinate pairs with the corresponding elevation and\\naccumulated distance data from the strava.com/stream/ID API\\nendpoint. Since an authenticated user can make a maximum of 375\\nrequests to Strava’s stream API per day, we use multiple accounts to\\nspeed up the download process. Despite downloading with multiple\\naccounts to circumvent rate limiting, our data set took three months\\nto collect. Before storing our collected data in our database, we\\npseudonymized the data by replacing original user IDs with an\\nautoincremented primary key upon request of our IRB. We repeat\\nthe same procedure for activity IDs.\\nTo obtain the road graph for each EPZ, we use the OSMnx frame-\\nwork [8] to download the OpenStreetMap road network in a graph\\nformat (see Figure 4a).\\n5.2 Data Characteristics\\nWith the aforementioned methodology, we collected a data set of\\n1,404,886 activities created by 4,000 users. We plot several distribu-\\ntions within this data set in Appendix B. The distribution of number\\nof activities per user is shown in Figure 11, with a median of 136\\nactivities per user. Our data set is geographically diverse as shown\\nin Figure 12, containing activity endpoints from 160 different coun-\\ntries. The data set provides different densities and layouts of road\\nnetworks, which is an important factor for the efficacy of our attack\\nas shown in Section 6.4.4.\\nWe observe that 461 users (11.53% of our total data set) use at\\nleast one EPZ to cloak activities.

Since most fitness tracking social networks use an auto-\\ncomplete address form for the creation of privacy zones, we then\\ndesignate the streetside location of the closest address to these clus-\\nter’s centroids as our ground-truth location\\n𝑣𝐺𝑇 ∈𝑉 (i.e., the point\\nthat a user would configure as a protected location). We believe that\\ninferring likely protected locations from uncloaked activities is the\\nmost feasible way to generate a sufficiently large-scale yet reliable\\nground truth. We note that our approach to obtaining ground truth\\nis almost identical to that of the existing state of the art [24].\\nUsing the aforementioned methodology, we constructed 4,689\\nground-truth locations for 2,527 users (63.18 % of entire data set).\\nWe were unable to construct at least one reliable ground-truth\\nlocation for the other 1,473 users due to a lack of geographically\\nconcentrated, uncloaked activities of the Walk, Run or Ride type.\\n6.2 Prediction Evaluation\\nFor each ground-truth location, we synthesize an EPZ, with its\\ncenter randomly translated from that location, for each radius in\\nthe set of radii available in Strava. We consider this set of radii as\\nexemplar since Strava is one of the most popular FTSNs, and since\\nit supports the largest EPZ radii. In the case that multiple protected\\nlocations of the same user are located inside the same EPZ, i.e.,\\ncloser to each other than the EPZ radius (8% of 200m EPZs), we\\nonly synthesize an EPZ around the protected location with the\\nmost activity observations. We then simulate the cloaking of these\\n–previously uncloaked– activities by removing all points that fall\\nwithin the synthetic EPZ. Finally, we evaluate our attack by predict-\\ning the corresponding protected location of each (synthesized) EPZ\\nusing Algorithm 2 with the locally cloaked activity data as input.\\nWe then compare this prediction (i.e., the result of our algorithm)\\nwith the ground-truth location.\\nWe measure the predictive error of Algorithm 2 by construct-\\ning confidence intervals (CIs) using bootstrapping [18], a random\\nsampling method with replacement. We run our algorithm (using\\nthe parameters in Table 2b) 1000 times with resampled data from\\nthe observed activities 𝑎, retaining the original number of cloaked\\nactivities for this EPZ. This yields 1000 (not necessarily distinct) pre-\\ndicted locations 𝑉𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑑 ⊆𝑉, which we denote as the CI constructed\\nby bootstrapping. This finally allows us to estimate the probability\\ndistribution c𝑃𝑟(𝑣|𝑎), i.e., protected locations 𝑣 ∈𝑉 given the user’s\\nactivities 𝑎, with the probability quantified as the number of times\\nthe location was predicted out of the 1000 runs of our algorithm.\\nNote that this probability is, therefore, zero for locations that were\\nnever predicted, i.e., 𝑣𝑝 ∈𝑉𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑑 ⇔c𝑃𝑟(𝑣𝑝|𝑎)> 0. We compute an\\nextended CI 𝑉𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑑,𝑒𝑥𝑡 ⊆𝑉 to account for the ‘overshoots’ caused\\n5While FTSNs do not explicitly show that an EPZ is used, we infer whether an activity\\nis cloaked by checking if there is a discrepancy in the visible distance and total distance\\nof an activity.\\nby activities starting or finishing away from the road graph (Sec-\\ntion 4.3.4).

First, we analyze whether FTSNs\\nleak sufficient distance metadata through their APIs to enable our\\nattack. Table 3 shows that the EPZ implementations of 3 and 5\\nfitness tracking social networks are vulnerable to our attacks in an\\ninner and total distance scenario (Section 4.3), respectively. Relive\\nis the only network that is never vulnerable to our attack, since\\nit enforces EPZs by truncating activities to only the track outside\\nthe EPZ when uploading. However, this truncation significantly\\nreduces usability (Section 7).\\nNext, we examine the efficacy of our attack with the privacy\\nmetrics from Section 6.2 on the collected data set from Section 5\\nagainst all radii in the studied radii set. The results for the inner\\ndistance and total distance scenario are shown in Tables 4 and 5\\n(Appendix C) respectively, and visualized altogether in Figure 6.\\nNote that, except for success rate, which is computed as a percentage\\nof binary success across all EPZs, we report the median across all\\nEPZs of the per-EPZ privacy metric values.\\nIn the inner distance scenario, we achieve a success rate of up\\nto 85% for EPZs with a radius of 200 m, the most popular option\\nacross Strava users (Figure 13). We notice a decrease in efficacy\\nof the attack as the EPZ radius increases, as depicted in Figure 6.\\nNevertheless, even for the largest radius (1600 m), we still success-\\nfully deanonymize 39% of protected locations. We achieve almost\\nidentical success rates for the total distance scenario.\\nFor larger radii, the number of nodes inside the EPZ (i.e., the\\ncandidate protected locations), as well as the number of nodes at\\nroughly the same distance from the entry gates of the EPZ increases.\\nThis leads to more confusion between candidate locations in our\\nLAD regression from Section 4.3.4, since more candidate nodes\\nhave similar distances. Increasing the radius, therefore, yields pre-\\ndictions with increased accuracy (i.e., larger confidence intervals),\\nwhich in turn, enlarges the uncertainty region from the adversary’s\\nperspective. Reduction of the 𝑘-anonymity set, on the other hand,\\nincreases because the growth of the accuracy is smaller than the\\ngrowth of the number of candidate nodes.

In the total distance scenario, we have\\nfewer ‘suitable’ activity endpoints compared to the inner distance\\nscenario: as mentioned in Section 4.3.3, we filter out the activity\\nendpoints where the user did not follow the shortest path. This\\nreduction in suitable endpoints negatively impacts the performance\\nof the attack, as we will discuss in Section 6.4. For smaller radii,\\nthe total distance attack has a slightly higher accuracy, resulting\\nin smaller reduction and larger uncertainty areas compared to the\\ninner distance attack.\\nThe confusion also negatively impacts the correctness of our\\nprediction, since the probability of predicting nodes other than\\nthe ground truth increases. Moreover, the larger the radius, the\\nless probable it is that a user takes the shortest path inside the\\nEPZ, violating Assumption A4. To a lesser extent, the number of\\nactivities our model can use for its prediction decreases as larger\\nradii are (nearly) enveloping entire activities. We achieve a median\\ncorrectness of 15m for the inner distance scenario and a 200 m\\nradius vs. 29m in the total distance scenario.\\nAn adversary will have similar certainty for both distance scenar-\\nios, steadily increasing with increasing radius (which also increases\\nthe number of nodes), meaning that an attacker is less confident in\\nselecting one solution 𝑣𝑝 ∈𝑉𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑑. However, using spatial certainty\\nas a metric, an attacker is more confident in (geographically) pin-\\npointing one location in the inner distance scenario than the total\\ndistance scenario. For the most popular radius, our attack achieves\\na median spatial certainty of almost 0, meaning that we are able\\nto pinpoint a single location. Finally, the Degree of Anonymity\\nremains almost constant with increasing radius for both attack\\nscenarios, since the certainty of the attacker increases linearly with\\nthe logarithm of the 𝑘-anonymity set size.\\n \\n809'),\n",

Our attack achieves a success rate\\ncomparable to that of Hassan et al. ’s main attack which uses circle\\nfitting [24]. Hassan et al. report a global 84% success rate, and while\\ntheir results are not fully broken down by radius, they report a 44%\\nsuccess rate for 1 km radii. We achieve a success rate of up to 85%\\n(for 200 m radii) and a 55% success rate for 1 km radii. However,\\nour attack works for a harder-to-break EPZ implementation that\\nincludes spatial cloaking, for which Hassan et al. ’s main attack does\\nnot work, and we use a lower error threshold ( 𝜏𝑒 = 22.95 m for\\nus vs. 50 m for Hassan et al.). In addition, Hassan et al. proposed\\nspatial cloaking as a countermeasure, and evaluated an alternative\\ninterpolation attack on EPZs to which spatial cloaking has been\\napplied [24, Section 6.4]. Their attack relies only on route direction,\\nresulting in a success rate of at most 45% (for a radius of 200 m). Our\\nattack using regression across distance metadata performs up to two\\ntimes better (for similar radii) than Hassan et al. ’s alternative attack,\\nwith our attack having up to 85% success, again at a stricter error\\nthreshold. Therefore, we effectively circumvent the countermeasure\\nof Hassan et al. adopted by major FTSNs.\\nMink et al. [35] found that human users can infer up to 68% of\\nall sensitive locations in their data set, but again for the original\\nEPZ implementation without spatial cloaking and with a laxer error\\nthreshold. In comparison, our (automated) attack achieves a higher\\nsuccess rate and works on EPZs with spatial cloaking by leveraging\\ntopological information. While Mink et al. propose that humans\\nmay also use topological information for visual inference, we con-\\njecture that the need to visually trace the precise distances travelled\\nwithin the EPZ will make the visual inference task much less suc-\\ncessful at deanonymizing spatially cloaked protected locations than\\nour LAD regression.\\n6.4 Sensitivity Analysis\\nIn order to better understand the conditions in which our attack\\nperforms better or worse, and eventually develop more effective\\ncountermeasures, we now analyze attack performance when differ-\\nent factors are varied.\\n6.4.1 Suitable Activity Endpoints. We first analyze whether more\\nactivities and endpoints lead to better performance. As the number\\nof activity endpoints (i.e., observations for LAD regression in Sec-\\ntion 4.3.4) increases, the variance of the difference between observed\\nand theoretical distances for our prediction will decrease. More ac-\\ntivities contribute to a slightly higher success rate for predictions,\\nindependent of the EPZ radius, as Figure 7 indicates.\\n6.4.2 Entry Gates. An increased number of entry gates yields a\\nslightly higher success rate for smaller radii, as can be seen in Fig-\\nure 7. The effect for larger radii is nullified by users not taking the\\nshortest path. In fact, the geographic distribution of entry gates\\nhas a higher impact on the success rate of our predictions than the\\nnumber of entry gates.\\n6.4.3 Blind Spot Angle. We present the maximum blind spot angle\\nas a metric to measure this geographic distribution and define it as\\nthe maximum angle between entry gates relative to the center of\\nthe EPZ. Smaller blind spot angles provide more diversified obser-\\nvations for the LAD regression in Section 4.3.4 than observations\\nwithin one entry gate. These diverse observations increase the dif-\\nference between theoretical shortest path distances and observed\\ndistances of erroneous nodes, making it less likely that the LAD\\nregression selects the wrong locations. This explains the higher\\nsuccess rate, as can be seen in Figure 7.\\n6.4.4 Density of Road Network. As the EPZ radius increases, we\\nobserve an increasing negative effect of increased street density\\n(expressed as meters of road per square kilometer) on the success\\nrate of our predictions, as Figure 7 shows. As the density increases,\\nso does the number of nodes with the same distance from the entry\\ngates of the EPZ. This increased number of candidate nodes causes\\nconfusion in the LAD regression, resulting in larger confidence\\nintervals and the prediction of incorrect nodes which, in turn, has\\na negative influence on the success rate. Moreover, a denser road\\nnetwork gives the user more routes to take that are not the shortest\\npath, again violating Assumption A4.\\nAs one might expect for a distance-based attack, performance\\nprimarily depends on geographic factors. Increased geographic\\ndiversity in entry gates reduces confusion between candidate lo-\\ncations, particularly with sparser street grids and with smaller\\nmaximum blind spots. An increased number of activities is, there-\\nfore, only useful for our predictions if they introduce additional\\ngeographic disparity. Otherwise, their effect on the performance of\\nour attack is moderate.\\n7 COUNTERMEASURES\\nOur evaluation shows that identifying protected locations remains\\nfeasible with current EPZ implementations. While other privacy\\ndefenses exist, users tend to use these in combination with EPZs,\\nand users still find EPZs efficient [35]. In this section, we therefore\\ndevelop and evaluate potential countermeasures that support the\\ncontinued use of EPZs by making EPZs more resilient against our\\nattack. We evaluate our countermeasures on the inner distance\\nscenario of an EPZ with a radius of 400 meters. This inner dis-\\ntance scenario on a small radius is favorable from the adversary’s\\nviewpoint, yet accounts for the majority of EPZs in our data set as\\ndiscussed in Section 5.2. We also discuss the usability and privacy\\nimplications and trade-offs of our countermeasures.\\n7.1 Distance-Focused Countermeasures\\nOur attack primarily relies on the availability of the distance cov-\\nered within the EPZ. Countermeasures could seek to obfuscate\\nthese distances, in order to increase the error in our regression.\\nThis also has the effect of altering the total traveled distance.\\nC1 – Generalization. By reducing the precision of any reported\\ndistance shown to a non-owner user [51], the adversary would be\\nunable to reliably determine the distance between the actual and\\ncloaked start/finish points (whether inner or total distances). This\\nreduces the precision of the last step of Algorithm 2 (Section 4.3.4),\\nin which we search the point where the theoretical shortest path\\ndistances best correspond to the actually observed distances. We\\nimplement generalization by rounding distances to the nearest\\nmultiple of a certain integer value. In Figure 8, we evaluate the\\nperformance of our attack given different roundings of the inner\\n \\n810'),\n",

This makes the\\nadversary more certain of their false predictions.\\nC2 – Noisy distances. This countermeasure applies random noise\\nto the reported distance, instead of rounding it. This adds more\\nuncertainty to the predictions of the adversary, resulting in bigger\\n6Note that metrics for C2 and C3 strongly overlap.\\nconfidence intervals and uncertainty regions, as depicted in Figure 8.\\nHowever, multiple activities from the same entry gate would result\\nin these random shifts being averaged out, causing the ground truth\\nto be present in the confidence interval. With the ground truth still\\npresent in the confidence interval, we observe no change in the\\nsuccess rate.\\nC3 – Shifting distances. The reported endpoints are shifted by a\\nfixed or random distance, while retaining the originally traveled dis-\\ntance as the total distance. However, similar to the noisy distances\\ncountermeasure, these random shifts may be averaged out across\\nactivities. In Figure 8, we see an increased uncertainty region of\\nthe adversary compared to the baseline. However, since the success\\nrate has not changed, 𝑘-anonymity has not been restored.\\nC4 – Truncation. A more invasive countermeasure consists of\\neliminating the track portions lying within the EPZ entirely, by not\\nincluding them in the reported total and accumulated distances,\\nor even hiding the full track. This would effectively thwart our\\nattack, as we can no longer infer where on the street grid inside\\nthe EPZ the activity may have started and ended; only a random\\nguess among all possible protected locations remains possible.\\nThe main disadvantage of altering the reported distances lies in\\ntheir negative usability impact. Whereas in other location-based\\nservices such as check-in apps, an error of several hundreds of\\nmeters may be acceptable [6], this may be less the case for fitness\\nsocial networks. Part of the attraction of these networks comes\\nfrom the gamification of exercise activities [7], such as achieve-\\nments for covering certain distance goals or being able to compare\\nacross small performance differences (in the order of seconds) [14],\\nwhich require high detail in activity data. Aggressive rounding\\nof distances would result in losing the desired precision at which\\nthe distance and pace are measured, possibly leading to overesti-\\nmated achievements. Removing the track portions inside the EPZ\\nand shortening the track distance is, therefore, also unattractive: it\\nwould result in underestimating the achieved distance.\\n7.2 EPZ-Focused Countermeasures\\nCountermeasures could target the EPZ to decrease (the utility of)\\navailable data or the identification of the EPZ (Algorithm 1).\\nC5 – Increasing EPZ radii. An obvious countermeasure is increas-\\ning the EPZ radius. Our evaluation in Section 6.3 confirms that,\\nfor circular EPZs, the attack performance decreases when the EPZ\\nradius increases.

This might also be why larger EPZ radii are less popular than\\nsmaller radii (as seen in our data set in Section 5.2).\\nC6 – Complex EPZs/cloaking. Beyond circular EPZs with a small\\nset of possible radii, different EPZ layouts could be implemented:\\ncircles with any radius or even any shape. Hassan et al. [24] pro-\\nposed a similar strategy by hiding a (small) track portion of random7\\nlength beyond the EPZ border (“Fuzz EPZ Intersection Points”). Al-\\nternatively, the concept of a ‘zone’ could be discarded, and instead\\na fixed or variable distance from the start and finish points could\\nbe cloaked, as Strava has recently implemented [32]. For our attack,\\nthis only affects the phase of identifying EPZs, as this step will\\nbe less reliable due to the noise applied to the cloaked endpoints.\\nAfterwards, the countermeasure has no effect on our location pre-\\ndiction algorithm: the inner/total distances and endpoints remain\\navailable, and allow for regression.\\nMore complex zones require more complex identification algo-\\nrithms, beyond the least squares fit for circular EPZs (Algorithm 1).\\nThese algorithms may be less accurate at identifying EPZs. More\\ncomplex zones may also make the removal of deviating activities\\n(Section 4.3.3) less effective, as the threshold for becoming an outlier\\nbecomes less likely to be met. However, as stated in Section 4.2,\\nour attack still works with imprecise EPZ identification. Counter-\\nmeasures that make EPZ discovery harder, therefore, cannot fully\\nthwart our attack. Crucially, these countermeasures do not affect\\nthe availability nor accuracy of the reported distances. Any increase\\nin the search space due to a less compact EPZ will reduce the attack\\nperformance by increasing the likelihood that an erroneous loca-\\ntion is predicted, and it will make the attack more computationally\\nexpensive.\\nFinally, a number of apparent countermeasures may seem effec-\\ntive at first, but can potentially improve the efficacy of our attack.\\nRegeneration of an EPZ recomputes the endpoints for every (future)\\nactivity, and may, therefore, generate additional entry gates, as the\\nedge of the EPZ has now shifted. This yields additional and more\\ndiverse data, which could improve the correctness of our attack,\\nsince our evaluation in Section 6.4 shows that correctness tends\\nto decrease when there are more entry gates and activities. Next,\\nsmoothing the track by map matching nodes to the road network\\nwould remove any (small) deviations that cause the actual traveled\\ndistance to not match the theoretical shortest path exactly, and\\nwould, therefore, make the LAD regression step more accurate.\\nIn summary, distance-based countermeasures and in particular\\ngeneralization are the most effective, but can severely reduce usabil-\\nity. Countermeasures that target EPZ discovery are less invasive,\\nbut only partially prevent our attack.\\n8 RELATED WORK\\nTwo recent works have analyzed vulnerabilities in previous imple-\\nmentations of EPZs where no spatial cloaking was applied and the\\ncenter of the EPZ was therefore the protected location.

[24] proposed several countermea-\\nsures, which were implemented by some fitness tracking networks.\\nCrucially, both works therefore only prove the vulnerability of\\nan EPZ implementation that is by now arguably outdated. In con-\\ntrast to both works, our attack breaks the current state-of-the-art\\nEPZs, i.e., those when spatial cloaking is present, with a comparable\\nor higher success rate than the prior work, on a harder-to-break\\nEPZ implementation. We also analyze in depth to which factors of\\nprivacy zones our attack is sensitive.\\nOther work has explored other privacy concerns in sharing loca-\\ntion data on fitness tracking social networks. Beyond privacy zones,\\nMeteriz et al. [34] found that elevation profiles could be sufficient\\nto recover a location at borough- or city-level, even if the location\\ndata is not shared. They require prior knowledge of potentially vis-\\nited locations, which are predicted at very low granularity, unlike\\nour attack. Alqhatani and Lipfore [2], Zimmer et al. [56], Gabriele\\nand Chiasson [20], Couture [14], and Mink et al. [35] described\\nhow users are somewhat aware of the privacy implications of shar-\\ning location data on fitness tracking social networks, but that this\\nawareness may be insufficient. They also found that users differ\\nin their sensitivity to having sensitive locations publicly available,\\ncorrelating with concerns on personal space and physical safety.\\nMink et al. [35] found that users consider EPZs an effective privacy\\nmechanism, but that these users would mostly use EPZs together\\nwith other privacy mechanisms.\\nBeyond fitness services, prior work has evaluated the feasibility\\nof de-anonymizing implementations for location proximity, where\\nthe distance to nearby users is shown instead of their actual location.\\nLi et al. [29] developed attacks for three popular location proximity\\nservices, accurate to up to 25 meters. Argyros et al. [40, 6] showed\\nthat major location proximity services remained vulnerable to lo-\\ncation inference attacks, despite existing countermeasures. These\\nattacks were sufficiently performant to enable real-time tracking.\\nThese two studies proposed some form of spatial cloaking [23] as\\nan effective countermeasure. Qin et al.

Cheng et al. [13] evaluated the trade-off between\\nsuch cloaking and the quality of the provided service, and pro-\\npose imprecise queries across cloaked locations to improve this\\ntrade-off. Ardagna et al. [5] concretely defined obfuscation tech-\\nniques on circular zones (compare to circular EPZs). Duckham and\\nKulik [17] formalized obfuscation as a means to achieve location\\nprivacy, implemented through precision reduction (similar to cloak-\\ning). Andrés et al.

We disclosed our findings to the affected parties from Table 3\\nby sending them a draft of this manuscript and by formulating\\nrecommendations for improving the privacy of their users.\\n10 CONCLUSION\\nMajor fitness tracking social networks have introduced endpoint\\nprivacy zones as a tool to protect sensitive locations from being\\nrevealed to malicious actors. However, despite the usage of spa-\\ntial cloaking, we show that these protected locations can still be\\ndiscovered reliably. Our attack leverages the reported distances\\ntraveled within the EPZ, as well as the layout of the street grid\\nto deanonymize protected locations with a success rate of up to\\n85%. While distance-based countermeasures such as generalization\\ncan be effective at thwarting our attack, they can also severely re-\\nduce usability. Networks must, therefore, carefully consider which\\nfunctionality they provide while guaranteeing user privacy.\\n11 ADDENDUM: SPATIAL CERTAINTY\\nWe design a new metric to measure spatial certainty, which rep-\\nresents the geographical closeness of predictions. For example,\\nconsider two situations (a) and (b), depicted in Figure 9, where an\\nattacker predicts four locations inside an EPZ with uniform proba-\\nbility. Whereas the predictions in (a) are geographically dispersed,\\nthe predictions in (b) are geographically concentrated.\\nShokri [46] defined certainty as the Shannon entropy [44] of\\nthe estimate probability distribution c𝑃𝑟(𝑣|𝑎). This entropy shows\\nhow concentrated c𝑃𝑟(𝑣|𝑎)is and, thus, how easy it is to pinpoint\\na single outcome 𝑣𝑝 ∈𝑉𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑑. Since this distribution c𝑃𝑟(𝑣|𝑎)is the\\n(a) Geographically dispersed predic-\\ntions of an adversary.\\n(certainty=1.39, spatial certainty=1.39)\\n(b) Geographically concentrated pre-\\ndictions of an adversary.\\n(certainty=1.39, spatial certainty=0.0)\\nFigure 9: Geographical plot of predictions of an adversary.\\nEach node 𝑣 ∈𝑉, displayed in red, is a potential protected\\nlocation. Each actual predicted node 𝑣𝑝 ∈𝑉𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑑 is displayed\\nin blue.\\nsame in (a) as in (b), it will result in the same value for certainty.\\nHowever, the certainty value does not give a notion of the spatial\\nconcentration of predictions.\\nBy increasing the chaining resolution (i.e., reducing the chaining\\ndistance 𝑑𝑐ℎ𝑎𝑖𝑛, as explained in Section 4.3), the number of possible\\nprotected nodes 𝑣 ∈𝑉 increases. This will make it harder for an\\nattacker to pinpoint a single solution𝑣𝑝 ∈𝑉𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑑. However, we only\\nclaim to predict a location with 𝜏𝑒 precision. Therefore, we should\\nconsider neighborhoods of nodes within 𝜏𝑒 when determining if a\\nprediction is sufficiently close to the protected location.\\nWe additionally define spatial certainty as Karlstrom and Cec-\\ncato’s entropy [26]. Instead of using the logarithm of the probability\\nof a single node 𝑣 as the surprisal term in the entropy formula, we\\nuse the logarithm of the sum of all neighboring nodes 𝑣𝑗 probabili-\\nties of 𝑣 including 𝑣 itself:\\n−\\n∑︁\\n𝑣∈𝑉\\nc𝑃𝑟(𝑣|𝑎)log\\n\\x10\\nd𝑃𝑟𝑛(𝑣|𝑎)\\n\\x11\\nA node 𝑣𝑗 is considered a neighbor of 𝑣 if the Euclidean distance\\nbetween both nodes is less than or equal to 𝜏𝑒:\\nd𝑃𝑟𝑛(𝑣𝑖|𝑎)=\\n∑︁\\n𝑣𝑗∈𝑉\\n𝑤𝑖𝑗c𝑃𝑟(𝑣𝑗|𝑎)\\nwith 𝑤𝑖𝑗 =\\n(\\n1, if dist(𝑣𝑖,𝑣𝑝)≤ 𝜏𝑒\\n0, otherwise\\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\\nWe thank the anonymous reviewers for their valuable and construc-\\ntive feedback, as well as the Security Analytics SIG at DistriNet.\\nThis research is partially funded by the Research Fund KU Leuven,\\nand by the Flemish Research Programme Cybersecurity.

Foreword
Barbara Fister,
Gustavus Adolphus College
All of us feel overwhelmed, at one point or another, by the
seemingly unstoppable accumulation of mail in our inboxes,
the stream of news coming at us from so many directions, often
feeding yet more news across cryptic fl owing banners, the
mysterious switchbacks we encounter as we navigate common
medical advice – that thing that was good for you? It’s not,
after all – and the frustration of hearing two equally passionate
sides to every debate, when we know the truth doesn’t come in
neat binaries. Information is too much with us, and too much
of it is trivial or dubious or drawn from unconvincing evidence.
But when we need to fi gure things out, we do the research.
Those of us teaching fi rst-year college students usually
confront another problem that also feels overwhelming at
times. Students have always had trouble writing research
papers, but on top of the usual culprits – choosing topics
that are too narrow or too broad, providing a data-dump
rather than an analysis, misusing words, splicing sentences
together with commas when they aren’t fragmenting them –
we have to help them fi nd their way through an abundant
but increasingly complex information environment. Instead
of going to the library, students go to Google, where
scholarly sources, advocacy, government documents, personal
narratives, news sources, scans of nineteenth-century books,

and home-made videos are all shelved together, millions
upon millions of documents available on any topic. If
students are savvy enough to turn to the library’s website,
they are likely to search an aggregated database that includes
more articles from more journals than any undergraduate
library previously subscribed to. They have endless choices
to make, but they can’t fall back on a scaffold of understanding
that more experienced scholars take for granted. They don’t
know the simplest things: that books have indexes, and that
by using an index or table of contents they could get
information from a book without having to read it cover-
to-cover. They probably have never seen a scholarly journal
in print, and don’t realize such periodicals are published
serially. They think ‘argument’ means a fi ght to the fi nish,
not developing a reasoned position based on evidence. And
they aren’t sure, but they think Time magazine is what their
teacher means when they say ‘use scholarly sources.’
Lacking experience with traditional research tools is one
thing; they also lack experience with developing researchable
questions, drawing conclusions from evidence, examining
sources critically, or having their minds changed when
confronted with data that confl icts with their preconceptions.
And (though this is nothing new) they lack a sense of urgency
or commitment to doing research. A research assignment
is just another jump-through-the-hoops demonstration for
their teacher, another checkpoint that will show they did
their homework, however grudgingly. An effi cient strategy
for getting through a research assignment with a minimum of
effort, though rarely an effective one, is viewed as a survival
skill, and rather than learn new ways to fi nd out about the
world, students will almost always draw on whatever tools
and strategies they have used in the past. They are busy
people; they don’t have time to mess around. The fact that
their college has a vast library of resources and their teachers

have high expectations doesn’t budge them from their course.
Google has worked before, and everyone knows essays
should be fi ve paragraphs long. Come up with something to
say, fi nd a few sources to support it, and you’re done. That
shouldn’t take more than a few hours, right?
The research paper remains the most common writing
assignment on college campuses, more popular than ever
(Lunsford, 2008). In the fi rst year, just as students are
encountering the conventions of academic writing, we also
hope to ground them in the mechanics of using a print/digital
hybrid library, probably much larger than any they’ve ever
used before, to make informed choices among possible
sources, and extract meaning from them in order to support
a well-organized synthesis or argument. We know they will
be asked to do this in the future, so we try to get them
acculturated quickly.
This puts a lot of responsibility on those who teach fi rst-
year students the ropes of academic writing. Many instructors
are dismayed to fi nd, when they collect drafts of papers,
that the library tour they scheduled in the second week of
the course seems to have had no effect at all. No matter how
much detail they put into the assignment prompt describing
how to recognize high-quality sources, the bibliographies are
full of sites from About.com and Knowledge Quest. And
worst of all, the students seem already jaded, indifferent to
the thrill of the hunt or the opportunity to pursue a question
they care about. Yet apart from preparing inexperienced
students for college, instructors know that these skills are for
life. We need citizens that can fi nd and interpret information,
that respect evidence, that are prepared to question
assumptions and ask the right questions. We know what
happens in that fi rst year matters. And it’s not easy.
This book, written by an experienced academic librarian,
is for every fi rst-year instructor who has tried semester after

semester to refi ne their research activities with students, only
to be defeated by a new crop of novices. It’s for every teacher
who is puzzled by students who seem so savvy about
technology, but so incapable of using it for academic
purposes. It’s for every librarian who wants to work more
effectively with the faculty who help new students negotiate
an unfamiliar and challenging set of expectations. It’s for
anyone who cares about the success of those fi rst-year
students.
Molly Flaspohler, who has observed students’ confusion
from the front lines of their forays into research and who has
collaborated successfully with faculty to make research a
more meaningful opportunity for learning, presents a well-
organized and entertaining review of what we know about
how students today approach research assignments, suggests
how (and why) librarians and teaching faculty should
collaborate fruitfully, and offers practical, experience-tested
pedagogical approaches to introducing reluctant researchers
to the intellectual work of articulating questions and seeking
evidence-based solutions, work that can turn novice
researchers into engaged students, ready to take the next step
in their academic journey.
